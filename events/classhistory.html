				<div class="one937-txt timeline-info-txt">
					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1937</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">For the first time in many years, the lower half of the Class of '37 are made of only male students due to non-coed admission. Incoming freshmen are welcomed cheerfully by the sophomore class with "extra curricular matriculation", a series of regulations informed while freshmen are crowded into a room. These rules include no mustaches, white socks, lavender and black tie, frosh [freshman] cap, bible or smoking. Pranks became such a problem that on November 16, 1933 the Dean's office issues a complaint from the police department against certain students who participated in the kidnapping of another student by means of a taxi. The students could have been shot if they had not been recognized by the police during one of the freshmen-sophomore activities.
					<br />
					The seniors of 1937 became known as 'social seniors' for their proactive attitude in the welfare of the campus. The Student Council and Student Body sponsor an anti-Nunan program bill as well as a non-pledge to Herbert Robinson, President of the Student Council, to any war the United States might conduct. Students and faculty hold four strikes in a vigilant effort for peace.
					<br />
					In May, class members are chided by the Board of Higher Education for "gratuitous obscenity" in the April Fool's issue of The Campus. (The paper is suspended for the rest of that semester, and two editors are expelled.) An investigation is launched by College President Robinson after "The Campus" newspaper publishes articles on the bookstore's mysterious $1,600 deficit. "The Mercury" is no longer known as "the sexiest of all sexy college periodicals", due to the efforts of editor Roger Helprin.
					Changes in military courses occur as money and supplies are granted to aid loyalists in Spain. Higher Education Week, Peace Week and actions from the Board of Education contribute to new legalizations, as well as a resolution to allow student organizations to be recognized if names of their officers, member and the organizations' principles are submitted. This is the first step to forming a club on the campus.
					<br />
					The Law Society is established in 1933. The Caduceus Society, a club for students on the pre-med track, is created in 1935. The Journal of the Baskerville Chemical Society is established. The 'Circolo Dante Alighuire' (C. D. A) is formed to promote social and intellectual well-being of Italian students at college. The Advertising Society begins, with the help of Fred Rosen. The fusion of two Jewish organizations lead to the formation of the Menorah-Avukah Conference. The newly established Interclass Athletic Committee is lead by Wally Klein. Captain Kotzebue leaves the Cadet Club, but Major Moore aptly fills his shoes.
					<br />
					The play "Squaring the Circle" becomes the Dramatic Society's most successful production in three years. House Plan activities are popular, such as the teas, and the mega Carnival. The Soph Smoker is a huge success. So is the Junior Jamboree. The class of 1937 celebrates beer becoming legal again by having a festival at the Hotel Brierfield. The Senior prom is held at the Tower Club of the Park Central Hotel. Professor Ross A. Baker is voted the most popular professor. Chamber of Commerce scholarships are awarded to Abe Briloff and Milt Lichtenthal. Two juniors B Gene Zorn and Charlie Gollup-become the first ever elected to the national honorary business fraternity Betta Gamma Sigma. Irv Kane and Charlie Rabkin share first place in the Cooper Blades advertising contest.
					<br />
					The athletes of Class of 1937 participate in a variety of sports activities, from water polo to boxing. Championships are celebrated for basketball stars Wally Klein, Ace Goldstein, Hal Kaufman, Sy Weinstein and Meger Samberg; fencing victors Chet Lambertt and Sid Kaplan; and wrestlers Milt Mendelowitz and Milt Lauter. Coach Benny Friedman leads the football team to a bittersweet glory, as Aaron Greenwald passes away due to injuries from a football game against NYU in the fall of 1937.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="one938-txt timeline-info-txt">
					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1938</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">In the mist of Word War II, the class of 1938 were engaged in defining the balance between receiving a quality college education and the reality of a prominent world wide crisis that touched the lives of many CCNY students. Despite the political trauma that surfaced in many parts of the United States, the students of the City College of New York showed that a good college education and a sometimes spontaneous social life style can be achieved in an era of propaganda and an unstable political and social atmosphere.
					<br />

				It is not hard to imagine that a military influenced association flourished on the City College campus when the country was about to enter the second biggest war the world has ever seen. In 1921, a group of five ambitious undergraduates sought to foster the spirit of camaraderie and good fellowship among the officers of the R.O.T.C. by establishing the new Officers' Club of CCNY. The club sparked the recruitment of over a hundred members, five times the number of members when it was initially founded. The Officers' Club varied activities provided the focal point for the social life of its cadet officers. The activities of the Officers' Club were far from being restricted to simply club activities. Whenever there was an official college ceremony such as Charter Day or Commencement, it was the members of the club who had the responsibility of acting as standard bearers. During Army Day or Armistice Day parades, and other civic functions, the club members would perform the duties of the ceremonies.
				<br />

				On April 13, 1934, the Class of 1938 witnessed the feverish activity of the first anti-war strike. Eight hundred students gathered at a flagpole meeting, which was led by the passionate, deep-voiced Eddie Alexander. The College authorities had previously declared such a meeting illegal. The meeting was broken up by acting Dean Morton D. Gottschall, who was aided by Sergeant Buccarelli of the Military Science Department and the police.
				<br />

				Election for the class council made Robert van Santen president, Joseph Brody, vice-president and Cliff Sagar, secretary. The class sponsored a newspaper, The Recorder, which was issued only once until its reappearance as the Jester in the senior year. In September, the second half of the class poured in through the portals of the Colleges and filled what President once called "these cloistered halls". There the class of 1938 elected Solomon Chaikin to the presidency and secretariate.
				<br />

				On December 7, Mr.Mortimer Karpp, then advisor to the freshmen class, introduced the House Plan idea at a "free cigarette" smoker. Seventeen of the twenty-one students who had been expelled for their activities in the "Jingo Day" celebration of 1933, marked by the famous incident of the flailing umbrella, were reinstated.
				<br />

				In an era of global political struggle, a spark of a roaring fire was ignited here at the City College of New York, when the Campus announced on the fifth of October that a small group of touring Italian students (the Italian government was under Fascism at the time) were to appear at the freshmen chapel in the Great Halls. The Student Council planned a protest meeting and sent a letter to President Robinson, calling for a cancellation of the official College welcome. On October 9, two thousand students jammed into the Great Hall. President Robinson's welcome speech was greeted with boos and hisses by the students. Edwin Alexander, representative of the Student Council, gave a politically motivated address, which ticked off the Italian students, who were offended by being labeled "enslaved by their Fascist government." Alexander was forced off the stage while thousands of students roared "Let Alexander speak !" The conflict waged on between the student body and the administration, which prompted the college to temporarily suspend Student Council activities until both sides came to terms.
				<br />

				The college's Society of Optimists was set up in 1935 by a group of pre-medical hopefuls who had decided to look into their common problems for themselves. Spurred on by the loud and long laments of the many City College students who failed to be admitted to med school, the founders established the society. The primary function of the organization was to be the study of ways and means to aid these and future undergraduates in their pursuit of med-school.
				<br />

				The rivalry between CCNY and NYU was played out on the football field and the basketball court. While NYU seemed to have the advantage in tournament play, CCNY athletes were motivated to defeat their arch nemeses. CCNY closed its basketball season with an 13-3 record and was regarded as a great team, despite not being a championship team.
				<br />

				The fall of 1935 saw the beginning of a new era in the social lives of City College men, when the gym dances made their first appearance under the sponsorship of the House Plan. Other organizations soon followed suit, and these affairs became frequent, enjoyable, and financially successful.
				<br />

				Even though the class of 1938 could not predict their future, they knew for certain that strength and optimism were imprinted on them by their individual experiences in the City College of New York.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="one939-txt timeline-info-txt">
					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1939</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">
						The Class of '39, which had helped revive social activities on campus, outdid itself in the senior term with the musical comedies "Brother Frat" (presumably a spin on the "Brother Rat" films that starred Ronald Reagan, among others), a presentation of the fraternities, and Dramsoc's What's the Youth, which ran for four nights. The boatride and gym dances were also popular.
						<br />
						Fraught relations between the student body and City College President Frederick B. Robinson - which included the announcement of the dismissal of English Professor Morris U. Schappes, followed by protests and demonstrations and, ultimately, the granting of tenure to Mr. Schappes via a Board of Higher Education ruling - had come to an end in the summer of 1938 with the announcement granting a leave of absence to the president. Nelson Mead, chairman of the History department, was named acting president. Robinson subsequently offered his official resignation, which was accepted by the Board on December 16.
						<br />
						Events in Europe were followed closely, as Hitler was accommodated by England's Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and the Czechoslavak Republic was sacrificed at the "peace" of Munich. A "Save Czechoslovakia Rally" became the largest meeting of the term, with the Czech president's brother and former Czech Senator, Vojta Benes, welcomed by Student Council President Harold Roth in the Great Hall, along with other speakers. Graphic description of the lack of academic freedom under totalitarianism was given at the draping of the Nazi college flags in the Great Hall, with the words "Till the old Germany shall awake" affixed to the pillars under the flags.
						<br />
						Foreign conflicts were brought even closer to home when it was announced that, in addition to other CCNY boys, Ralph Wardlaw, instructor in the Public Speaking Department, and Jack Freeman, President of the '39 class, had died in Spain, fighting Fascist aggression.
						<br />
						Despite the weight of world events and tensions at home, or perhaps as a necessary counterbalance, the College managed to foster and maintain a busy social and club life. The Faculty Council requirement that clubs list their members in the Dean's office was repealed, thus removing a source of friction.
						<br />
						The big event of the season was the Senior Prom. Held at the Astor Roof Garden, it featured Artie Gellin's orchestra and Audrey Christie and Charles Walters of "I Married an Angel" as reigning King and Queen.
						<br />
						The Senior History section of the 1939 Microcosm concludes on an ominous note, suitable to a nation still recovering from the Great Depression and observing the conflicts abroad with growing concern: "Now we must face the unpleasant prospect of a world with steadily dwindling opportunities, a country which is no longer 'the golden land of opportunity.'"
						<br />
						Many of these Class notes are excerpted from the 1939 Microcosm, Editor-in-Chief Stanley Lowenbraun.

				<!-- 1940s -->

				<div class="one940-txt timeline-info-txt">
					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1940</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">
						Dedicated to "the Fight to Keep America out of War," the 1940 Microcosm yearbook reflected the tumultuous world events happening throughout the graduating students' time at The City College of New York. There were efforts to aid Loyalist Spain; the College was shocked when the conflict claimed the lives of Ralph Wardlaw, instructor of Public Speaking, and Jack Freeman '39. Vojta Benes, brother of the Czechoslovakian president, pleaded his country's cause, and the German college flags in the Great Hall were draped in black with the words, "Till the old Germany shall awake." In April 1939, a Student Council-American Student Union anti-war demonstration drew 2,000 people, while an opposition strike, where the Oxford Pledge was taken, drew only 400. In the fall of 1939, nonetheless, students returned from their vacations with the declaration of war ringing in their ears.
						<br />
						The key words regarding student-administration relations for the Class of 1940's first two years at CCNY were, according to Microcosm: "Oust Robinson." In 1938, City College's fifth president, Frederick Robinson, retired. Professor Nelson P. Mead became Acting President, and the change "ushered in a new deal in student relations with the Administration." (The next CCNY President, Harry N. Wright, would assume office in 1941.)
						<br />
						Campus facilities remained an issue, even with a more cooperative administration. The Student Council elected in the fall of 1938 succeeded in having decrepit lavatories repaired, although for sometime after the toilets were not separated by partitions. A sympathetic member of the Board of Higher Education, Mrs. Carrie K. Medalie, promised, if possible, to have lounges and study rooms installed, but "rosy dreams vanished before budget economy."
						<br />

						"Budget economy" did not prove too daunting for the Senior Prom, however. Held at the Hotel Ambassador, the affair was so successful that last minute sales had to be refused. And the House Plan Carnival, which had grown too big for the gym and took over the Main Building, had the Mauve Decade as its theme and offered a Bowery atmosphere, with a great variety of booths and entertainment. Guest of Honor Ben Bernie, a radio personality known as The Old Maestro and famous for his catchphrase, "Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah," was on hand to crown the Queen of the Carnival.
						<br />

						It is interesting to note that the Microcosm Editor-in-Chief, Alan L. Otten '40, went on to a distinguished career as a journalist, writing for the Wall Street Journal for 44 years. He passed away in August 2009, at age 88.
						<br />

						The editors of Lexicon dedicated their yearbook to Professor Herbert Ruckes, member of the Biology department and faculty adviser to Lexicon and the Class of 1940, because "he humored us and helped us whenever we needed him; he never ceased his untiring efforts in our behalf."
						<br />

						The senior class of The City College, School of Business and Civic Administration of the College of the City of New York held its Senior Prom on the night of December 9, 1939. "The Italian Gardens of the Hotel Ambassador shone brightly as the seniors and their escorts danced into the wee hours of the morn to the strains of Geroge Strete's orchestra." For Senior Week, the famous team of Abbott and Costello (before they were film stars) provided comic entertainment. "They were great and kept the audience in stitches throughout the performance."
						<br />

						A survey of the senior class, included in a section of the yearbook called What We Think, provided some interesting questions and answers, a quick snapshot of what was on the collective mind of the Class of 1940. How much do you spend on your average date? $2.00. Who is your favorite movie actor? Paul Muni. Movie actress? Bette Davis. Whom do you consider the most famous scientist? Professor Albert Einstein. What is your favorite novel? The Grapes of Wrath. Favorite play? Abe Lincoln in Illinois.
						<br />

						In a more serious question capturing the anxiety of the time, students were asked, under three different sets of circumstance, "Would you enlist or wait to be drafted or would you be a conscientious objector?" In a war on foreign soil, 5 percent of respondents said they would enlist, 39 percent would wait to be drafted, and 56 percent would be conscientious objectors. In a war in North or South America, 11 percent would enlist, 65 percent would wait to be drafted, and 24 percent would be conscientious objectors. In a war on U.S. soil, a large majority of respondents - 69 percent - said they would enlist. Another 30 percent said they would wait to be drafted, and just 1 percent answered that they would claim "conscientious objector" status.
						<br />

				<div class="one941-txt timeline-info-txt">
					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1941</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">
						The 1941 Microcosm was dedicated to the preservation of the ideals upon which City College was founded. In response to war abroad and censorship in the States, the class of 1941 sought to defend the values of democracy at the College. As stated in Microcosm: "Academic freedom, merely an abstract concept to us in high school, commanded our attention in college as a sharp reality to be fought for and preserved."
						<br />
						Formed in 1939, the American Student Union took the lead to mobilizing student opinion and action. While students fought against McCarthyism and censorship taking place on campus, they also rallied against those who tarnished the reputation of the College by referring to it as the "little red schoolhouse." The concern of communism at City College led the Board on Higher Education to pass a resolution forbidding Communists from holding teaching positions, and the Taxpayers Federation called for the abolition of the College as a free institution.
						<br />
						In addition to fighting for academic freedom on campus, the American Student Union organized the College's greatest student sponsored peace demonstration in 1941. Four thousand students attended. As the war progressed, sharp differences of opinion arose on campus. Some students called for collective action against Hilter, while the others thought it necessary to focus their attention on fighting Fascism at home rather than abroad.
						<br />
						The relationship between students and the administration during this period was plagued with challenges. In 1938, City College's fifth president, Frederick Robinson retired. Chairman of the History Department, Professor Nelson P. Mead became Acting President, which "ushered a new deal in student-administration relations." In 1941, Acting President Mead announced his resignation and was replaced by Professor Harry N. Wright, Director of the Evening Session.
						<br />
						In spite of the difficult student-administration relationship, opportunities for students to socialize were plentiful. College-wide activities and social functions on campus were on the upswing thanks to the efforts of House Plan and other student groups. Students spent Friday afternoons dancing the "shag" and the "big apple" at Townsend Harris auditorium. The Student Council sponsored the first school-wide boat ride to Bear Mountain in the Spring of '37. The second annual House Plan Carnival, held in the gym, gave the class its first taste of an affair which in succeeding years became one of the biggest events at the College.
						<br />
						In athletics, basketball reigned as the "King of City College sports." During the '40-'41 season, Coach Holman turned out a fine record of 14 won and 4 lost, winning the invitation to play at Madison Square Garden, where they took third–place ranking.
						<br />
						Academics still dominated student life at the College. The Student Council conducted a two-year survey amongst students and Gibbs '39 of House Plan carried out a course-evaluation in hopes of improving the College's curriculum and student satisfaction. As a result of these surveys, the seven minutes allocated between classes was extended to 10 minutes. Moreover, the comprehensive senior reading and foreign language examinations were abolished. Additionally, the Evening Session was reorganized and an African-American history class was offered for the first time.
						<br />
						Members of the class of 1941, saw even greater change beyond the academic curriculum. In spring 1938, a loop-hole in the College's by-laws enabled the first female student into the School of Technology. By 1941, the School had seven women in its student body of approximately six thousand men. Students also experienced a closer cooperation between the municipal government and the College with greater opportunities to participate in internships with city agencies.
						<br />
						Academic improvements were of course limited by budget concerns. There was a lack of support for publications on campus. The College's newspaper, The Campus, beset by financial and editorial difficulties was discontinued for more than a semester. From March until October 1940, City College did not have a newspaper.
						<br />
						The graduates of the Class of 1941 had an uncertain future ahead of them as they entered a world "gone mad, a world hell- bent on destroying itself and everything in it." As the editor of Microcosm stated: "Now we go, fortified with a two dollar sheepskin and a sound education, to challenge a world in the darkest blackout in history....It's not a picnic. Some of us are going to fall pretty early, and of us, who have the grit and stamina, will see this through the finish. And that finish is peace, security, and a better world." Though all graduates faced challenges after graduation, many did succeed. Practically all the engineering graduates of 1941 were placed in engineering positions upon earning their degree. The Federal Service felt the need for engineers to be so great that they did not hold competitive examinations, but merely accepted student based on education.
						<br />
						Many of these class notes are excerpted from the 1941 Microcosm, Editor-in-Chief Albert Greenberg.

				<div class="one942-txt timeline-info-txt">
					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1942</h2>

						For four years the Class of 1942 has worked and struggled –along with the rest of the College—to prove that City College is an institution which the tax payers have every reason to be proud not ashamed, of; that is attended by loyal young men who are prepared to accept responsibilities of citizenship; that whatever else it may be, it is not "a little Red schoolhouse." But for nearly four years all these counterclaims fell on ears that would not hear and eyes that would not see, the eyes and ears of the Hearsts, Rapps, Couderts, Manning and McGeehans of New York."
						<br />
						Led by the Class of '42 the College became one of the major centers of New York City's war effort. On December 8, 1941 one of the largest student gatherings took place in Great Hall to listen to President Franklin D. Roosevelt request a declaration of war against Japan from Congress. This marked the beginning of an intense activity as the College immediately went on a war footing.
						<br />
						The CCNY Student Defense Council, one of the first in the country, selling more than $250,000 worth of stamps and bonds; this led the Red Cross to dedicate two City College days. In the Great Hall, the foreign minister of the Czechoslovak Republic, Dr. Masaryk, spoke at a United Nations rally on April 9, and, in the fall, Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt gave a "Win the War" lecture at the College.
						<br />
						Spurred by the emergency, and then by the actual entrance of the United States into the war, the City College unit of Reserve Officers' Training Corps increased enrollment from a total of 1200 two years ago to over 2300, making it the largest ROTC unit in the country.
						<br />
						In the midst of the war effort, life at the College continued on. House plan, the social hub of the College, proved to be an ever-expanding circle in more ways than one. House plan grew older and bigger, not only in number of members and social events, but in physical proportions. The original building, 292 Convent Ave was joined with 294 in a simple fashion: by tearing down the wall.
						<br />
						The honorary society Sigma Alpha produced Ticker Tape, a publication compiled of stories from CCNY students stationed on military bases all over the world. Ticker Tape is mailed to 1,300 young men in the service.
						<br />
						The newly built cafeteria opened on campus. The construction of a new lunchroom meant the end of the alcoves.
						<br />
						CCNY's fencing team had a successful season beating its long-standing rival NYU. Coach Nat Holman led CCNY's basketball team to four consecutive victories over NYU in the ardently-fought series knotted 14-all. Baseball witnessed a new era with the appointment of Sam Winograns as coach. CCNY's swim team won seventeen of twenty-six meets over the four years. Track runner, Dave Polansky set a new record for the 1/2 mile run. The cross country team had the most successful season in College history winning 2 out of 5 meets.
						<br />
						All in all, the Class of '42 experienced a rollercoaster four-years: "They have been in the college for four years, in that period of time, world events—as distinguished from laboratory events—have rocked by with the blurring speed; as a result, the world into which they are entering on resembles in a few ways the one that existed in January and September 1938. This means that their place in the world is a changed one, a more responsible one. Four years ago words like unemployment and recession hung around their necks like millstones. Today, every single one of them is certain of a job. But a different kind of job that the sort that they had earlier been concerned with."

						The 1943 Microcosm was dedicated to "the people's cause to the Century of the Common Man."
						<br />
						The Class of 1943 felt the impact of World War II and understood the necessity for undergraduate participation. In October 1941, the Student Council took the lead on other colleges by creating the Student Council Defense Committee. Under Leonard Cohen, the Committee embarked on campaigns to enlist civilian defense workers of all sorts, to sell War Saving Bods and Stamps, and to collect scrap, books and organize a City College group of blood donors.
						<br />
						The administration joined the war effort by creating the Civil Defense Council. CDC sponsored a variety of drives. City College led all other colleges in bond and stamp sales, bring in a total of over a quarter million dollars.
						<br />
						In 1941, using WPA labor, a roomy new drill-hall for City College's growing ROTC program was erected and dedicated by Mayor LaGuardia. The program increased enrollment from 1200 students to 2300, making it the largest ROTC unit in the country.
						<br />
						The Student War Board instituted a series of weekly "Win the War" forums featuring prominent speakers. In the Great Hall, the foreign minister of the Czechoslovak Republic, Dr. Masaryk, spoke at a United Nations rally on April 9, and, in the fall, Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt gave a "Win the War" lecture at the College.
						<br />
						In the midst of the war effort, life at the College continued. A new student newspaper, Spirit of '43, was launched but halted publication after the Junior Prom. A number of smokers were held in the old Armory and the Hamilton Hotel. Uniformed students attend the Senior Prom at the Plaza Hotel, as gasoline and other cut rations reminded students of the ongoing war. The Junior Nite Dance was held in Hansen Hall. The technology fraternity, Epsilon Nu Gamma was formed and planned smokers, bowling parties, and dances. House Plan held a "huge social affair" in Drill Hall. There were also Friday afternoon dances and boat rides which provided several hundred students with one-day pilgrimages to Bear Mountain.
						<br />
						The College also welcomed a new president. Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia and Justice Felix Frankfurter attend the inauguration ceremony as Dr. Harry N. Wright replaced Acting President Dr. Nelson P. Mead as the new president of the City College. In student government, the office of the '43 Student President changed hands three times before it came to rest securely with Bill Rosenblum.
						<br />
						in the summer of 194, renovation of the student lunchroom began. Finally in 1942, the eagerly awaited eatery opened for business. The passing of the "black hole of City College" or "academic sardine can," as it was called, terminated one of the most colorful chapters in the College's history. While the remodeling did away with the unpopular stand-up-and-eat tables, it also removed the famed alcoves with their daily diet of political arguments, horse-play, and ping-pong matches. Alcove One with Iggy Olicker which provided hours of entertainment and laughter was forever gone.
						<br />
						In sports, CCNY's fencing team had a successful season beating its long-standing rival NYU. Coach Nat Holman led CCNY's basketball team to four consecutive victories over NYU in the ardently-fought series knotted 14-all. Baseball witnessed a new era with the appointment of Sam Winograns as coach. CCNY's swim team won seventeen of twenty-six meets over the four years. Track runner, Dave Polansky set a new record for the 1/2 mile run. The cross country team had the most successful season in College history winning 2 out of 5 meets.
						<br />
						The CCNY football team played against Brooklyn College and raised $2,588 for the Red Cross. The tennis team went undefeated for the first time in City College's history.

					<p class="timeline-des">
						The 1944 Microcosm-Lexicon was dedicated to "A New world of Freedom."
						<br />
						In the words of the 1944 Microcosm-Lexicon: "Nineteen forty-four was a year of strife, a year of disorder, a year of sacrifice; a year but containing one bright ray of sunshine—the certainty of ultimate victory. But out of the chaos that engulfed the entire globe a new day, a new way of living was to arise. We stood on the threshold of a long-awaited changed world—a world of Freedom, not only political, but economic and social as well; Freedom for all races, all creeds, all opinions."
						<br />
						The 600 men and women that comprised the Class of 1944 welcomed Professor Harry N. Wright, Director of the Evening Session, as the new president of City College in September 1942. Dr. Wright replaced the Chairman of the History Department, Nelson P. Mead who served as Acting President after the College's fifth president, Frederick Robinson retired in 1963.
						<br />
						In addition to a new president, the Class of '44 welcomed a number of more female students to its ranks. In their freshman year, a couple of women had slipped through the loophole in the Tech School's rules, to major in engineering. After that, in 1942, three professional schools of the college—Technology, Business, and Education, opened their doors to women. Only the College of Liberal Arts and Science remained adamant against the admission of women.
						<br />
						Pursuing their education in the midst of World War II, the Class of 1944 was faced with unique challenges and opportunities. With ever-growing frequency 1944 classmen were drafted into various services; large numbers of the remainder of the Class of '44 males enlisted.
						<br />
						Spurred by the emergency, and then by the actual entrance of the United States into the war, the City College unit of Reserve Officers Training Corps increased enrollment from a total of 1,200 two years ago to over 2,300, making it the largest ROTC unit in the country.
						<br />
						Many members of the Class of '44 faced a spirited race between graduation and the army. In 1943, the elimination of the usual spring vacation for the purpose of permitting a lengthened summer term, in accordance with the new accelerated program afforded men the chance to earn their degree and speed up their graduation.
						<br />
						Determined to support the War Effort to the best of their abilities, the Class of '44 helped organize one of the first Student Defense Councils in the country.Under the leadership of Leonard Cohen, the CCNY Student Defense Council sold more than $250,000 worth of stamps and bonds; this led the Red Cross to dedicate two City College days.
						<br />
						While the pleasures of the future were uncertain, the Class of 1944 took full advantage of all the social activities on campus. The Class of '44 enjoyed its first co-ed affair, the Soph Strut, a dance in the Hotel Pennsylvania's Keystone Room with Orrin Tucker and his band providing the music. The Class of '44 also enjoyed the Gala Junior Nite Dance which was held in Hensen Hall. During the senior prom, 129 couples danced and dined at the beautiful Starlight Roof at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
						<br />
						Sports continued to be one of the most popular class activities. For the second straight semester, the Class of '44 won the Intermural Pennant. Marve Kuperman exhibited his great capabilities by doubling as Athletic Manager and Editor of the Intramural Leader. Contributing to their intramural success were Stan Kugan, Paul Pilzer and others.

					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1946</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">
						In 1946, City College opened its doors to veterans returning from the war, welcoming 1,700 veteran students in the Fall Semester and 3,000 in the spring. The College designed special programs for those who returned from service mid-semester, allowing them to catch up with their peers. Seven hundred female students also joined the student body in the spring.
						<br />
			            On May 7th, 1946, the College held a memorial for the students and faculty members who lost their lives in the war. The ceremony coincided with the College’s 99th anniversary and featured an address by Lewis Mumford ’18, a former member of the Board of Higher Education who lost a son during the war, as well as readings by a Rabbi, a Protestant Minister, and a Catholic Priest.
			            <br />
			            During their four years at City College, students from the Class of 1946 forged new friendships that would last for many years to come. However, the College also helped to reunite long-lost friends who were torn apart by World War II. Alice Landau and Aisel Fuss had been classmates at L’Athenee de Jeunes Filles in Antwerp, Belgium before the war forced them to flee the country. Aisele sought refuge in New York and Alice fled to Brazil before eventually settling in New York as well. The two reunited at City College when Alice stopped a random stranger to ask for directions to the chemistry building. That stranger happened to be Aisele, her former classmate.
			            <br />
			            1946 was a notable year for student activism at City College. The Public Affairs Committee of the Student Council sponsored a rally to support the Indonesian struggle for independence. On February 21st at 12 PM, students assembled at Doremus Hall to listen to speeches by guest speakers from the Committee of Free Indonesia in San Francisco and to demonstrate their support for the movement. The speakers provided students with a first-hand account of Indonesian popular sentiment regarding independence and explained to them why the Indonesian populace was fighting so hard to achieve it.
			            <br />
						In addition to demonstrating its support for the Indonesian independence struggle, the Student Council also expressed its opposition to the Student-Faculty Committee’s ban on the distribution of outside literature at the College. The Council drafted a resolution that recommended that the Committee “allow any College organization to distribute outside literature on the campus as long as it is properly identified as literature of that organization.
						<br />
						Student representatives from the Tom Paine Club of American Youth for Democracy traveled to Albany to petition for the establishment of a state university system in New York. The members of the club believed that a state university system was necessary to provide equal educational opportunities to black, Jewish, and Catholic students, who were not admitted to many private universities at the time. The delegation also demanded that educational institutions that practice racial or religious discrimination have their tax-exempt status revoked.
						<br />
						1946 marked the return of City College’s soccer team from a 28-year hiatus. Under the leadership of Coach Ira Zasloff, the Beavers defeated Queens College 9-2 during their first match since 1918, earning two points during the game’s first period and six points in the second.
						<br />
						The Beavers were also victorious on the cross-country field. During the first meet of the season, City College defeated Brooklyn Polytech 15-40 at Van Cortlandt Park. The meet resulted in a three-way first place tie for Captain Harold Feigelson, Warren Bright, and Norm Zareko, who crossed the finish line arm-in-arm with a winning time of 31: 46.3 minutes. Fourth and fifth places were also snagged by members of City College’s team, with Bernard Kravitz crossing the finish line at 32:48 and Herb Benario coming in at 33:11.
						<br />
						In honor of City College’s approaching centennial, Harry N. Wright, City College’s president at the time, traveled to Washington, D.C. to present a medal to President Harry Truman on October 9th, 1946. During the College’s centennial celebration at Hotel Astor on October 12th, President Truman sent a congratulatory telegram stating that the <q>nation owes a great debt to its municipal colleges which, in the face of almost insufferable obstacles, have continued to provide educational facilities for young men and women who would otherwise have no opportunity to advance themselves.</q>

A War Bond Rally is held. Mollie of the Co-Op Store sends soldiers freshly-baked cookies, as blood donor drives are carried out by the War Activities Committee. Students spend as much time writing to the troops as they do with their homework. The Veteran's Club is formed during the war. It soon becomes the fastest growing organization on campus.
						<br />
						In 1943, the Chi Delta Rho fraternity halts activities since each of its members are called to serve in the war. However, fraternity brothers go the extra mile to keep in touch, taking 2,000 mile bomber trips and truck rides to meet each other all over Europe. Two Chi Delta Rho members, Jerry Harris and Ed Stone, unfortunately lose their lives in the war. The Lambda Sigma Phi sorority does lots of sewing and knitting for the Red Cross during the war, as part of its Social Service Program. The Phi Alpha Sigma sorority sells war stamps and bonds, hosts Friday afternoon parties, and holds a raffle for Red Cross Recreation Kits. Male students are welcomed back to the College from the war with a Spring Formal. Students and alumni alike endeavor to build a $1,500,000 war memorial building, through the Centennial fund campaign. The Churchill Lounge becomes the headquarters of the Centennial Fund Committee.
						<br />
						A dinner is held to commemorate the College's Centennial Anniversary. Alumni Bernard Baruch and Justice Frankfurter praise City College as, "...the only opportunity for higher education available to [us] and to so many others." New York City Mayor William O' Dwyer deems April 17th–24th "City College Centennial Week."

						With the help of Dean Wright, "Hell Week" is introduced. As a result, new pledgees and rushes are inducted through interesting tactics. The B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation at the College becomes popular and eventful after its February 1944 inception. The club, which is open to all CCNY students, hosts classes on Jewish History and the Bible, Yiddish, and Hebrew. Hillel social events include the United Jewish Appeal Carnival, Melaveh Malkah parties, the Passover Seder, and the Chanukah and Succoth parties.
						<br />
						The Newman Club plans and operates the World Student Service Fund Drive, and sponsors a dance for the benefit of Polish Relief. The club newspaper, "The Newmanite", is published once a month. In 1946, the Interclub Board is established. The board, or IBC, is an official Student Council sub-committee. It's purpose is to act as a coordinating cell between the College's many societies and organizations. The Alpha Mu Sigma fraternity is resurrected in 1944 after being founded in the 1920s and disappearing shortly afterwards. During January 1947, seventeen members are inaugurated into the official establishment of the William H. John Chapter of Alpha Delta Sigma, the College's advertising society.

					<p class="timeline-des">
						Class of '48...The end of one life...the beginning of another...a new tempo...new times...the times were different...buildings once unknown to female smiles, except for a girl engineer or two, now had their halls filled with coeds ...the armed services left only a scattering of men to walk them...12 girls entered in September '42 and passed through Lincoln Corridor...the following February, 20 more coeds were admitted...soon there were 700 and their influx only stopped when the restrictions were reinstated after the war..
						<br />
						December 8, 1941 was the turning point...the beginning of the exodus of men from the campus, of soldiers from this country, of Fascism from the world...President Roosevelt spoke to the nation...the college faculty and students listened and heard him call for a declaration of war...heard him plead for a better world to emerge from the ensuing blood and destruction...
						<br />
						Other things changed, increased, and swelled out with the new tempo and the strange times...the book store expanded into two stores, one in the Main building and another in Army Hall...later in the spring of 1948, a compulsory Student Activity Fee replaced the inadequate U-Card as a result of a student referendum...the new $1.50 fee helped ease the financial worries of most organizations...In the Fall of '47 the administration banned a speaker who had been invited by the Marxist Cultural Society...students were aroused to their meeting to abridge free speech...Then another blow...the City College budget was cut by the Mayor's Budget Committee which later revisited its estimate and granted an additional $51,000...this reduced the cut to $127,000...students, faculty, and administration protested...28 instructors and 12 clerical and laboratory workers would have to be dropped...students looked about them and saw crowded classes...knew the budget slash would make the classes larger...a protest rally, a strike, and a march on City Hall were recommended...all but the rally was called off...classes were cut and the audience was larger at the rally...
						<br />
						Men and women returned from the war...back to the subway college...some back to become '48 graduates...some never to come back, except in memory and memorials...The vets were back...tired, eager to get their degrees as fast as they could...they became the plodders, the leaders...
						<br />
						The times changed and moved on...the College played host for the first time on May 1, 1948 to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers...distinguished engineers from the industry and universities spoke...awards were given for the best student papers...the convention closed with a dance at the Hotel Ascot.
						<br />
						A women's basketball team was started this year...under the leadership of Coach Rosalind Garfinkel, the squad suffered only one defeat in a 5-game schedule...the swimming team also turned a winning record, with five victories in ten meets...the nocturnal Basketball team won 16 of 21 games for another outstanding record.

					<p class="timeline-des">
						Seven hundred vets registered for the fall 1945 term. Their numbers were steadily increasing as more ex-students became ex-GI's.
						<br />
						Enrollment figures skyrocketed upward when College statisticians reported that 32,000 students registered for Spring '47. The influx of veterans led to the launch of a new student publication, Observation Post, jointly sponsored by the American Veterans Committee and the Veterans Association. A Centennial Week was held from April 13 to April 19. Men who had been graduated from the College years ago - Senator Robert Wagner, statesman Bernard Baruch, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter – came back to revive old memories, say a few words, and receive honorary degrees.
						<br />
						September registration in 1947 threatened to swamp the College: 33,000 signed up for some learning, 8,000 in uptown day session. President Wright submitted a $7,000,000 budget request in the Spring term of '48 but, in what was to be a recurring trend, the Mayor's Budget Committee reduced it - by only $127,000 after protests helped to restore $58,000 from the original cut.
						<br />
						City College's School of Business and Civic Administration held its Senior Prom on the evening before the blizzard of December 1948, with approximately 250 students celebrating the conclusion of their four years at City College in the Roosevelt Hotel. The other City College Senior Prom took place on January 27, 1949, with more than one hundred fifty couples attending the party at the Hotel Astor Roof. Freshman Coralye Isaacs was selected as Miss Subways, conclusively demonstrating, according to Microcosm, "that our girls can hold their own in the beauty and charm, as well as brains departments." The College's Centennial Fund Drive benefitted that spring from the proceeds of a special concert presented at Carnegie Hall by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra,conducted by Maestro Arturo Toscanini and assisted by stars from the Metropolitan Opera.
						<br />
						Controversy that had been simmering for years reached a boiling point when Judge Hubert Delany resigned from the chairmanship of a special committee set up to investigate discrimination at the College. Charging that the Administration was not really interested in ending discrimination, the jurist's resignation sparked a student referendum vote that led to a student strike beginning on April 11, 1949. Police and strikers clashed, and eighteen students were arrested. At the center of the turbulence were two professors, William Knickerbocker, Chairman of the Romance Languages Department, and Economics Professor William Davis, whom the administration refused to dismiss, despite evidence of discriminatory practices. Although the strike did not bring about conclusive results, it gained considerable publicity and made clear that a better rapport between Administration and students would have to be forthcoming, or future demonstrations would occur.
						<br />
						Following the interruption of classes due to the strike, students caught up with their studies and seniors prepared for graduation. The ceremony took place in Lewisohn Stadium, with some 2,500 students in cap and gown. For the first time in four years, it did not rain on graduation day, presaging a bright future for the Class of '49.
