				<div class="one937-txt timeline-info-txt">
					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1937</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">For the first time in many years, the lower half of the Class of '37 are made of only male students due to non-coed admission. Incoming freshmen are welcomed cheerfully by the sophomore class with "extra curricular matriculation", a series of regulations informed while freshmen are crowded into a room. These rules include no mustaches, white socks, lavender and black tie, frosh [freshman] cap, bible or smoking. Pranks became such a problem that on November 16, 1933 the Dean's office issues a complaint from the police department against certain students who participated in the kidnapping of another student by means of a taxi. The students could have been shot if they had not been recognized by the police during one of the freshmen-sophomore activities.
					<br />
					The seniors of 1937 became known as 'social seniors' for their proactive attitude in the welfare of the campus. The Student Council and Student Body sponsor an anti-Nunan program bill as well as a non-pledge to Herbert Robinson, President of the Student Council, to any war the United States might conduct. Students and faculty hold four strikes in a vigilant effort for peace.
					<br />
					In May, class members are chided by the Board of Higher Education for "gratuitous obscenity" in the April Fool's issue of The Campus. (The paper is suspended for the rest of that semester, and two editors are expelled.) An investigation is launched by College President Robinson after "The Campus" newspaper publishes articles on the bookstore's mysterious $1,600 deficit. "The Mercury" is no longer known as "the sexiest of all sexy college periodicals", due to the efforts of editor Roger Helprin.
					Changes in military courses occur as money and supplies are granted to aid loyalists in Spain. Higher Education Week, Peace Week and actions from the Board of Education contribute to new legalizations, as well as a resolution to allow student organizations to be recognized if names of their officers, member and the organizations' principles are submitted. This is the first step to forming a club on the campus.
					<br />
					The Law Society is established in 1933. The Caduceus Society, a club for students on the pre-med track, is created in 1935. The Journal of the Baskerville Chemical Society is established. The 'Circolo Dante Alighuire' (C. D. A) is formed to promote social and intellectual well-being of Italian students at college. The Advertising Society begins, with the help of Fred Rosen. The fusion of two Jewish organizations lead to the formation of the Menorah-Avukah Conference. The newly established Interclass Athletic Committee is lead by Wally Klein. Captain Kotzebue leaves the Cadet Club, but Major Moore aptly fills his shoes.
					<br />
					The play "Squaring the Circle" becomes the Dramatic Society's most successful production in three years. House Plan activities are popular, such as the teas, and the mega Carnival. The Soph Smoker is a huge success. So is the Junior Jamboree. The class of 1937 celebrates beer becoming legal again by having a festival at the Hotel Brierfield. The Senior prom is held at the Tower Club of the Park Central Hotel. Professor Ross A. Baker is voted the most popular professor. Chamber of Commerce scholarships are awarded to Abe Briloff and Milt Lichtenthal. Two juniors B Gene Zorn and Charlie Gollup-become the first ever elected to the national honorary business fraternity Betta Gamma Sigma. Irv Kane and Charlie Rabkin share first place in the Cooper Blades advertising contest.
					<br />
					The athletes of Class of 1937 participate in a variety of sports activities, from water polo to boxing. Championships are celebrated for basketball stars Wally Klein, Ace Goldstein, Hal Kaufman, Sy Weinstein and Meger Samberg; fencing victors Chet Lambertt and Sid Kaplan; and wrestlers Milt Mendelowitz and Milt Lauter. Coach Benny Friedman leads the football team to a bittersweet glory, as Aaron Greenwald passes away due to injuries from a football game against NYU in the fall of 1937.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="one938-txt timeline-info-txt">
					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1938</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">In the mist of Word War II, the class of 1938 were engaged in defining the balance between receiving a quality college education and the reality of a prominent world wide crisis that touched the lives of many CCNY students. Despite the political trauma that surfaced in many parts of the United States, the students of the City College of New York showed that a good college education and a sometimes spontaneous social life style can be achieved in an era of propaganda and an unstable political and social atmosphere.
					<br />

					It is not hard to imagine that a military influenced association flourished on the City College campus when the country was about to enter the second biggest war the world has ever seen. In 1921, a group of five ambitious undergraduates sought to foster the spirit of camaraderie and good fellowship among the officers of the R.O.T.C. by establishing the new Officers' Club of CCNY. The club sparked the recruitment of over a hundred members, five times the number of members when it was initially founded. The Officers' Club varied activities provided the focal point for the social life of its cadet officers. The activities of the Officers' Club were far from being restricted to simply club activities. Whenever there was an official college ceremony such as Charter Day or Commencement, it was the members of the club who had the responsibility of acting as standard bearers. During Army Day or Armistice Day parades, and other civic functions, the club members would perform the duties of the ceremonies.
					<br />

					On April 13, 1934, the Class of 1938 witnessed the feverish activity of the first anti-war strike. Eight hundred students gathered at a flagpole meeting, which was led by the passionate, deep-voiced Eddie Alexander. The College authorities had previously declared such a meeting illegal. The meeting was broken up by acting Dean Morton D. Gottschall, who was aided by Sergeant Buccarelli of the Military Science Department and the police.
					<br />

					Election for the class council made Robert van Santen president, Joseph Brody, vice-president and Cliff Sagar, secretary. The class sponsored a newspaper, The Recorder, which was issued only once until its reappearance as the Jester in the senior year. In September, the second half of the class poured in through the portals of the Colleges and filled what President once called "these cloistered halls". There the class of 1938 elected Solomon Chaikin to the presidency and secretariate.
					<br />

					On December 7, Mr.Mortimer Karpp, then advisor to the freshmen class, introduced the House Plan idea at a "free cigarette" smoker. Seventeen of the twenty-one students who had been expelled for their activities in the "Jingo Day" celebration of 1933, marked by the famous incident of the flailing umbrella, were reinstated.
					<br />

					In an era of global political struggle, a spark of a roaring fire was ignited here at the City College of New York, when the Campus announced on the fifth of October that a small group of touring Italian students (the Italian government was under Fascism at the time) were to appear at the freshmen chapel in the Great Halls. The Student Council planned a protest meeting and sent a letter to President Robinson, calling for a cancellation of the official College welcome. On October 9, two thousand students jammed into the Great Hall. President Robinson's welcome speech was greeted with boos and hisses by the students. Edwin Alexander, representative of the Student Council, gave a politically motivated address, which ticked off the Italian students, who were offended by being labeled "enslaved by their Fascist government." Alexander was forced off the stage while thousands of students roared "Let Alexander speak !" The conflict waged on between the student body and the administration, which prompted the college to temporarily suspend Student Council activities until both sides came to terms.
					<br />

					The college's Society of Optimists was set up in 1935 by a group of pre-medical hopefuls who had decided to look into their common problems for themselves. Spurred on by the loud and long laments of the many City College students who failed to be admitted to med school, the founders established the society. The primary function of the organization was to be the study of ways and means to aid these and future undergraduates in their pursuit of med-school.
					<br />

					The rivalry between CCNY and NYU was played out on the football field and the basketball court. While NYU seemed to have the advantage in tournament play, CCNY athletes were motivated to defeat their arch nemeses. CCNY closed its basketball season with an 13-3 record and was regarded as a great team, despite not being a championship team.
					<br />

					The fall of 1935 saw the beginning of a new era in the social lives of City College men, when the gym dances made their first appearance under the sponsorship of the House Plan. Other organizations soon followed suit, and these affairs became frequent, enjoyable, and financially successful.
					<br />

					Even though the class of 1938 could not predict their future, they knew for certain that strength and optimism were imprinted on them by their individual experiences in the City College of New York.

				<div class="one939-txt timeline-info-txt">
					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1939</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">
						The Class of '39, which had helped revive social activities on campus, outdid itself in the senior term with the musical comedies "Brother Frat" (presumably a spin on the "Brother Rat" films that starred Ronald Reagan, among others), a presentation of the fraternities, and Dramsoc's What's the Youth, which ran for four nights. The boatride and gym dances were also popular.
						<br />
						Fraught relations between the student body and City College President Frederick B. Robinson - which included the announcement of the dismissal of English Professor Morris U. Schappes, followed by protests and demonstrations and, ultimately, the granting of tenure to Mr. Schappes via a Board of Higher Education ruling - had come to an end in the summer of 1938 with the announcement granting a leave of absence to the president. Nelson Mead, chairman of the History department, was named acting president. Robinson subsequently offered his official resignation, which was accepted by the Board on December 16.
						<br />
						Events in Europe were followed closely, as Hitler was accommodated by England's Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and the Czechoslavak Republic was sacrificed at the "peace" of Munich. A "Save Czechoslovakia Rally" became the largest meeting of the term, with the Czech president's brother and former Czech Senator, Vojta Benes, welcomed by Student Council President Harold Roth in the Great Hall, along with other speakers. Graphic description of the lack of academic freedom under totalitarianism was given at the draping of the Nazi college flags in the Great Hall, with the words "Till the old Germany shall awake" affixed to the pillars under the flags.
						<br />
						Foreign conflicts were brought even closer to home when it was announced that, in addition to other CCNY boys, Ralph Wardlaw, instructor in the Public Speaking Department, and Jack Freeman, President of the '39 class, had died in Spain, fighting Fascist aggression.
						<br />
						Despite the weight of world events and tensions at home, or perhaps as a necessary counterbalance, the College managed to foster and maintain a busy social and club life. The Faculty Council requirement that clubs list their members in the Dean's office was repealed, thus removing a source of friction.
						<br />
						The big event of the season was the Senior Prom. Held at the Astor Roof Garden, it featured Artie Gellin's orchestra and Audrey Christie and Charles Walters of "I Married an Angel" as reigning King and Queen.
						<br />
						The Senior History section of the 1939 Microcosm concludes on an ominous note, suitable to a nation still recovering from the Great Depression and observing the conflicts abroad with growing concern: "Now we must face the unpleasant prospect of a world with steadily dwindling opportunities, a country which is no longer 'the golden land of opportunity.'"
						<br />
						Many of these Class notes are excerpted from the 1939 Microcosm, Editor-in-Chief Stanley Lowenbraun.

				<div class="one940-txt timeline-info-txt">
					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1940</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">
						Dedicated to "the Fight to Keep America out of War," the 1940 Microcosm yearbook reflected the tumultuous world events happening throughout the graduating students' time at The City College of New York. There were efforts to aid Loyalist Spain; the College was shocked when the conflict claimed the lives of Ralph Wardlaw, instructor of Public Speaking, and Jack Freeman '39. Vojta Benes, brother of the Czechoslovakian president, pleaded his country's cause, and the German college flags in the Great Hall were draped in black with the words, "Till the old Germany shall awake." In April 1939, a Student Council-American Student Union anti-war demonstration drew 2,000 people, while an opposition strike, where the Oxford Pledge was taken, drew only 400. In the fall of 1939, nonetheless, students returned from their vacations with the declaration of war ringing in their ears.
						<br />
						The key words regarding student-administration relations for the Class of 1940's first two years at CCNY were, according to Microcosm: "Oust Robinson." In 1938, City College's fifth president, Frederick Robinson, retired. Professor Nelson P. Mead became Acting President, and the change "ushered in a new deal in student relations with the Administration." (The next CCNY President, Harry N. Wright, would assume office in 1941.)
						<br />
						Campus facilities remained an issue, even with a more cooperative administration. The Student Council elected in the fall of 1938 succeeded in having decrepit lavatories repaired, although for sometime after the toilets were not separated by partitions. A sympathetic member of the Board of Higher Education, Mrs. Carrie K. Medalie, promised, if possible, to have lounges and study rooms installed, but "rosy dreams vanished before budget economy."
						<br />

						"Budget economy" did not prove too daunting for the Senior Prom, however. Held at the Hotel Ambassador, the affair was so successful that last minute sales had to be refused. And the House Plan Carnival, which had grown too big for the gym and took over the Main Building, had the Mauve Decade as its theme and offered a Bowery atmosphere, with a great variety of booths and entertainment. Guest of Honor Ben Bernie, a radio personality known as The Old Maestro and famous for his catchphrase, "Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah," was on hand to crown the Queen of the Carnival.
						<br />

						It is interesting to note that the Microcosm Editor-in-Chief, Alan L. Otten '40, went on to a distinguished career as a journalist, writing for the Wall Street Journal for 44 years. He passed away in August 2009, at age 88.
						<br />

						The editors of Lexicon dedicated their yearbook to Professor Herbert Ruckes, member of the Biology department and faculty adviser to Lexicon and the Class of 1940, because "he humored us and helped us whenever we needed him; he never ceased his untiring efforts in our behalf."
						<br />

						The senior class of The City College, School of Business and Civic Administration of the College of the City of New York held its Senior Prom on the night of December 9, 1939. "The Italian Gardens of the Hotel Ambassador shone brightly as the seniors and their escorts danced into the wee hours of the morn to the strains of Geroge Strete's orchestra." For Senior Week, the famous team of Abbott and Costello (before they were film stars) provided comic entertainment. "They were great and kept the audience in stitches throughout the performance."
						<br />

						A survey of the senior class, included in a section of the yearbook called What We Think, provided some interesting questions and answers, a quick snapshot of what was on the collective mind of the Class of 1940. How much do you spend on your average date? $2.00. Who is your favorite movie actor? Paul Muni. Movie actress? Bette Davis. Whom do you consider the most famous scientist? Professor Albert Einstein. What is your favorite novel? The Grapes of Wrath. Favorite play? Abe Lincoln in Illinois.
						<br />

						In a more serious question capturing the anxiety of the time, students were asked, under three different sets of circumstance, "Would you enlist or wait to be drafted or would you be a conscientious objector?" In a war on foreign soil, 5 percent of respondents said they would enlist, 39 percent would wait to be drafted, and 56 percent would be conscientious objectors. In a war in North or South America, 11 percent would enlist, 65 percent would wait to be drafted, and 24 percent would be conscientious objectors. In a war on U.S. soil, a large majority of respondents - 69 percent - said they would enlist. Another 30 percent said they would wait to be drafted, and just 1 percent answered that they would claim "conscientious objector" status.

					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1941</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">
						The 1941 Microcosm was dedicated to the preservation of the ideals upon which City College was founded. In response to war abroad and censorship in the States, the class of 1941 sought to defend the values of democracy at the College. As stated in Microcosm: "Academic freedom, merely an abstract concept to us in high school, commanded our attention in college as a sharp reality to be fought for and preserved."
						<br />
						Formed in 1939, the American Student Union took the lead to mobilizing student opinion and action. While students fought against McCarthyism and censorship taking place on campus, they also rallied against those who tarnished the reputation of the College by referring to it as the "little red schoolhouse." The concern of communism at City College led the Board on Higher Education to pass a resolution forbidding Communists from holding teaching positions, and the Taxpayers Federation called for the abolition of the College as a free institution.
						<br />
						In addition to fighting for academic freedom on campus, the American Student Union organized the College's greatest student sponsored peace demonstration in 1941. Four thousand students attended. As the war progressed, sharp differences of opinion arose on campus. Some students called for collective action against Hilter, while the others thought it necessary to focus their attention on fighting Fascism at home rather than abroad.
						<br />
						The relationship between students and the administration during this period was plagued with challenges. In 1938, City College's fifth president, Frederick Robinson retired. Chairman of the History Department, Professor Nelson P. Mead became Acting President, which "ushered a new deal in student-administration relations." In 1941, Acting President Mead announced his resignation and was replaced by Professor Harry N. Wright, Director of the Evening Session.
						<br />
						In spite of the difficult student-administration relationship, opportunities for students to socialize were plentiful. College-wide activities and social functions on campus were on the upswing thanks to the efforts of House Plan and other student groups. Students spent Friday afternoons dancing the "shag" and the "big apple" at Townsend Harris auditorium. The Student Council sponsored the first school-wide boat ride to Bear Mountain in the Spring of '37. The second annual House Plan Carnival, held in the gym, gave the class its first taste of an affair which in succeeding years became one of the biggest events at the College.
						<br />
						In athletics, basketball reigned as the "King of City College sports." During the '40-'41 season, Coach Holman turned out a fine record of 14 won and 4 lost, winning the invitation to play at Madison Square Garden, where they took third–place ranking.
						<br />
						Academics still dominated student life at the College. The Student Council conducted a two-year survey amongst students and Gibbs '39 of House Plan carried out a course-evaluation in hopes of improving the College's curriculum and student satisfaction. As a result of these surveys, the seven minutes allocated between classes was extended to 10 minutes. Moreover, the comprehensive senior reading and foreign language examinations were abolished. Additionally, the Evening Session was reorganized and an African-American history class was offered for the first time.
						<br />
						Members of the class of 1941, saw even greater change beyond the academic curriculum. In spring 1938, a loop-hole in the College's by-laws enabled the first female student into the School of Technology. By 1941, the School had seven women in its student body of approximately six thousand men. Students also experienced a closer cooperation between the municipal government and the College with greater opportunities to participate in internships with city agencies.
						<br />
						Academic improvements were of course limited by budget concerns. There was a lack of support for publications on campus. The College's newspaper, The Campus, beset by financial and editorial difficulties was discontinued for more than a semester. From March until October 1940, City College did not have a newspaper.
						<br />
						The graduates of the Class of 1941 had an uncertain future ahead of them as they entered a world "gone mad, a world hell- bent on destroying itself and everything in it." As the editor of Microcosm stated: "Now we go, fortified with a two dollar sheepskin and a sound education, to challenge a world in the darkest blackout in history....It's not a picnic. Some of us are going to fall pretty early, and of us, who have the grit and stamina, will see this through the finish. And that finish is peace, security, and a better world." Though all graduates faced challenges after graduation, many did succeed. Practically all the engineering graduates of 1941 were placed in engineering positions upon earning their degree. The Federal Service felt the need for engineers to be so great that they did not hold competitive examinations, but merely accepted student based on education.

					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1942</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">
						For four years the Class of 1942 has worked and struggled –along with the rest of the College—to prove that City College is an institution which the tax payers have every reason to be proud not ashamed, of; that is attended by loyal young men who are prepared to accept responsibilities of citizenship; that whatever else it may be, it is not "a little Red schoolhouse." But for nearly four years all these counterclaims fell on ears that would not hear and eyes that would not see, the eyes and ears of the Hearsts, Rapps, Couderts, Manning and McGeehans of New York."
						<br />
						Led by the Class of '42 the College became one of the major centers of New York City's war effort. On December 8, 1941 one of the largest student gatherings took place in Great Hall to listen to President Franklin D. Roosevelt request a declaration of war against Japan from Congress. This marked the beginning of an intense activity as the College immediately went on a war footing.
						<br />
						The CCNY Student Defense Council, one of the first in the country, selling more than $250,000 worth of stamps and bonds; this led the Red Cross to dedicate two City College days. In the Great Hall, the foreign minister of the Czechoslovak Republic, Dr. Masaryk, spoke at a United Nations rally on April 9, and, in the fall, Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt gave a "Win the War" lecture at the College.
						<br />
						Spurred by the emergency, and then by the actual entrance of the United States into the war, the City College unit of Reserve Officers' Training Corps increased enrollment from a total of 1200 two years ago to over 2300, making it the largest ROTC unit in the country.
						<br />
						In the midst of the war effort, life at the College continued on. House plan, the social hub of the College, proved to be an ever-expanding circle in more ways than one. House plan grew older and bigger, not only in number of members and social events, but in physical proportions. The original building, 292 Convent Ave was joined with 294 in a simple fashion: by tearing down the wall.
						<br />
						The honorary society Sigma Alpha produced Ticker Tape, a publication compiled of stories from CCNY students stationed on military bases all over the world. Ticker Tape is mailed to 1,300 young men in the service.
						<br />
						The newly built cafeteria opened on campus. The construction of a new lunchroom meant the end of the alcoves.
						<br />
						CCNY's fencing team had a successful season beating its long-standing rival NYU. Coach Nat Holman led CCNY's basketball team to four consecutive victories over NYU in the ardently-fought series knotted 14-all. Baseball witnessed a new era with the appointment of Sam Winograns as coach. CCNY's swim team won seventeen of twenty-six meets over the four years. Track runner, Dave Polansky set a new record for the 1/2 mile run. The cross country team had the most successful season in College history winning 2 out of 5 meets.
						<br />
						All in all, the Class of '42 experienced a rollercoaster four-years: "They have been in the college for four years, in that period of time, world events—as distinguished from laboratory events—have rocked by with the blurring speed; as a result, the world into which they are entering on resembles in a few ways the one that existed in January and September 1938. This means that their place in the world is a changed one, a more responsible one. Four years ago words like unemployment and recession hung around their necks like millstones. Today, every single one of them is certain of a job. But a different kind of job that the sort that they had earlier been concerned with."

					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1943</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">
						The 1943 Microcosm was dedicated to "the people's cause to the Century of the Common Man."
						<br />
						The Class of 1943 felt the impact of World War II and understood the necessity for undergraduate participation. In October 1941, the Student Council took the lead on other colleges by creating the Student Council Defense Committee. Under Leonard Cohen, the Committee embarked on campaigns to enlist civilian defense workers of all sorts, to sell War Saving Bods and Stamps, and to collect scrap, books and organize a City College group of blood donors.
						<br />
						The administration joined the war effort by creating the Civil Defense Council. CDC sponsored a variety of drives. City College led all other colleges in bond and stamp sales, bring in a total of over a quarter million dollars.
						<br />
						In 1941, using WPA labor, a roomy new drill-hall for City College's growing ROTC program was erected and dedicated by Mayor LaGuardia. The program increased enrollment from 1200 students to 2300, making it the largest ROTC unit in the country.
						<br />
						The Student War Board instituted a series of weekly "Win the War" forums featuring prominent speakers. In the Great Hall, the foreign minister of the Czechoslovak Republic, Dr. Masaryk, spoke at a United Nations rally on April 9, and, in the fall, Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt gave a "Win the War" lecture at the College.
						<br />
						In the midst of the war effort, life at the College continued. A new student newspaper, Spirit of '43, was launched but halted publication after the Junior Prom. A number of smokers were held in the old Armory and the Hamilton Hotel. Uniformed students attend the Senior Prom at the Plaza Hotel, as gasoline and other cut rations reminded students of the ongoing war. The Junior Nite Dance was held in Hansen Hall. The technology fraternity, Epsilon Nu Gamma was formed and planned smokers, bowling parties, and dances. House Plan held a "huge social affair" in Drill Hall. There were also Friday afternoon dances and boat rides which provided several hundred students with one-day pilgrimages to Bear Mountain.
						<br />
						The College also welcomed a new president. Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia and Justice Felix Frankfurter attend the inauguration ceremony as Dr. Harry N. Wright replaced Acting President Dr. Nelson P. Mead as the new president of the City College. In student government, the office of the '43 Student President changed hands three times before it came to rest securely with Bill Rosenblum.
						<br />
						in the summer of 194, renovation of the student lunchroom began. Finally in 1942, the eagerly awaited eatery opened for business. The passing of the "black hole of City College" or "academic sardine can," as it was called, terminated one of the most colorful chapters in the College's history. While the remodeling did away with the unpopular stand-up-and-eat tables, it also removed the famed alcoves with their daily diet of political arguments, horse-play, and ping-pong matches. Alcove One with Iggy Olicker which provided hours of entertainment and laughter was forever gone.
						<br />
						In sports, CCNY's fencing team had a successful season beating its long-standing rival NYU. Coach Nat Holman led CCNY's basketball team to four consecutive victories over NYU in the ardently-fought series knotted 14-all. Baseball witnessed a new era with the appointment of Sam Winograns as coach. CCNY's swim team won seventeen of twenty-six meets over the four years. Track runner, Dave Polansky set a new record for the 1/2 mile run. The cross country team had the most successful season in College history winning 2 out of 5 meets.
						<br />
						The CCNY football team played against Brooklyn College and raised $2,588 for the Red Cross. The tennis team went undefeated for the first time in City College's history.

					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1944</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">
						The 1944 Microcosm-Lexicon was dedicated to "A New world of Freedom."
						<br />
						In the words of the 1944 Microcosm-Lexicon: "Nineteen forty-four was a year of strife, a year of disorder, a year of sacrifice; a year but containing one bright ray of sunshine—the certainty of ultimate victory. But out of the chaos that engulfed the entire globe a new day, a new way of living was to arise. We stood on the threshold of a long-awaited changed world—a world of Freedom, not only political, but economic and social as well; Freedom for all races, all creeds, all opinions."
						<br />
						The 600 men and women that comprised the Class of 1944 welcomed Professor Harry N. Wright, Director of the Evening Session, as the new president of City College in September 1942. Dr. Wright replaced the Chairman of the History Department, Nelson P. Mead who served as Acting President after the College's fifth president, Frederick Robinson retired in 1963.
						<br />
						In addition to a new president, the Class of '44 welcomed a number of more female students to its ranks. In their freshman year, a couple of women had slipped through the loophole in the Tech School's rules, to major in engineering. After that, in 1942, three professional schools of the college—Technology, Business, and Education, opened their doors to women. Only the College of Liberal Arts and Science remained adamant against the admission of women.
						<br />
						Pursuing their education in the midst of World War II, the Class of 1944 was faced with unique challenges and opportunities. With ever-growing frequency 1944 classmen were drafted into various services; large numbers of the remainder of the Class of '44 males enlisted.
						<br />
						Spurred by the emergency, and then by the actual entrance of the United States into the war, the City College unit of Reserve Officers Training Corps increased enrollment from a total of 1,200 two years ago to over 2,300, making it the largest ROTC unit in the country.
						<br />
						Many members of the Class of '44 faced a spirited race between graduation and the army. In 1943, the elimination of the usual spring vacation for the purpose of permitting a lengthened summer term, in accordance with the new accelerated program afforded men the chance to earn their degree and speed up their graduation.
						<br />
						Determined to support the War Effort to the best of their abilities, the Class of '44 helped organize one of the first Student Defense Councils in the country.Under the leadership of Leonard Cohen, the CCNY Student Defense Council sold more than $250,000 worth of stamps and bonds; this led the Red Cross to dedicate two City College days.
						<br />
						While the pleasures of the future were uncertain, the Class of 1944 took full advantage of all the social activities on campus. The Class of '44 enjoyed its first co-ed affair, the Soph Strut, a dance in the Hotel Pennsylvania's Keystone Room with Orrin Tucker and his band providing the music. The Class of '44 also enjoyed the Gala Junior Nite Dance which was held in Hensen Hall. During the senior prom, 129 couples danced and dined at the beautiful Starlight Roof at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
						<br />
						Sports continued to be one of the most popular class activities. For the second straight semester, the Class of '44 won the Intermural Pennant. Marve Kuperman exhibited his great capabilities by doubling as Athletic Manager and Editor of the Intramural Leader. Contributing to their intramural success were Stan Kugan, Paul Pilzer and others.

					<p class="timeline-des">
						In 1946, City College opened its doors to veterans returning from the war, welcoming 1,700 veteran students in the Fall Semester and 3,000 in the spring. The College designed special programs for those who returned from service mid-semester, allowing them to catch up with their peers. Seven hundred female students also joined the student body in the spring.
						<br />
			            On May 7th, 1946, the College held a memorial for the students and faculty members who lost their lives in the war. The ceremony coincided with the College’s 99th anniversary and featured an address by Lewis Mumford ’18, a former member of the Board of Higher Education who lost a son during the war, as well as readings by a Rabbi, a Protestant Minister, and a Catholic Priest.
			            <br />
			            During their four years at City College, students from the Class of 1946 forged new friendships that would last for many years to come. However, the College also helped to reunite long-lost friends who were torn apart by World War II. Alice Landau and Aisel Fuss had been classmates at L’Athenee de Jeunes Filles in Antwerp, Belgium before the war forced them to flee the country. Aisele sought refuge in New York and Alice fled to Brazil before eventually settling in New York as well. The two reunited at City College when Alice stopped a random stranger to ask for directions to the chemistry building. That stranger happened to be Aisele, her former classmate.
			            <br />
			            1946 was a notable year for student activism at City College. The Public Affairs Committee of the Student Council sponsored a rally to support the Indonesian struggle for independence. On February 21st at 12 PM, students assembled at Doremus Hall to listen to speeches by guest speakers from the Committee of Free Indonesia in San Francisco and to demonstrate their support for the movement. The speakers provided students with a first-hand account of Indonesian popular sentiment regarding independence and explained to them why the Indonesian populace was fighting so hard to achieve it.
			            <br />
						In addition to demonstrating its support for the Indonesian independence struggle, the Student Council also expressed its opposition to the Student-Faculty Committee’s ban on the distribution of outside literature at the College. The Council drafted a resolution that recommended that the Committee “allow any College organization to distribute outside literature on the campus as long as it is properly identified as literature of that organization.
						<br />
						Student representatives from the Tom Paine Club of American Youth for Democracy traveled to Albany to petition for the establishment of a state university system in New York. The members of the club believed that a state university system was necessary to provide equal educational opportunities to black, Jewish, and Catholic students, who were not admitted to many private universities at the time. The delegation also demanded that educational institutions that practice racial or religious discrimination have their tax-exempt status revoked.
						<br />
						1946 marked the return of City College’s soccer team from a 28-year hiatus. Under the leadership of Coach Ira Zasloff, the Beavers defeated Queens College 9-2 during their first match since 1918, earning two points during the game’s first period and six points in the second.
						<br />
						The Beavers were also victorious on the cross-country field. During the first meet of the season, City College defeated Brooklyn Polytech 15-40 at Van Cortlandt Park. The meet resulted in a three-way first place tie for Captain Harold Feigelson, Warren Bright, and Norm Zareko, who crossed the finish line arm-in-arm with a winning time of 31: 46.3 minutes. Fourth and fifth places were also snagged by members of City College’s team, with Bernard Kravitz crossing the finish line at 32:48 and Herb Benario coming in at 33:11.
						<br />
						In honor of City College’s approaching centennial, Harry N. Wright, City College’s president at the time, traveled to Washington, D.C. to present a medal to President Harry Truman on October 9th, 1946. During the College’s centennial celebration at Hotel Astor on October 12th, President Truman sent a congratulatory telegram stating that the <q>nation owes a great debt to its municipal colleges which, in the face of almost insufferable obstacles, have continued to provide educational facilities for young men and women who would otherwise have no opportunity to advance themselves.</q>

						The Newman Club plans and operates the World Student Service Fund Drive, and sponsors a dance for the benefit of Polish Relief. The club newspaper, "The Newmanite", is published once a month. In 1946, the Interclub Board is established. The board, or IBC, is an official Student Council sub-committee. It's purpose is to act as a coordinating cell between the College's many societies and organizations. The Alpha Mu Sigma fraternity is resurrected in 1944 after being founded in the 1920s and disappearing shortly afterwards. During January 1947, seventeen members are inaugurated into the official establishment of the William H. John Chapter of Alpha Delta Sigma, the College's advertising society.

						Other things changed, increased, and swelled out with the new tempo and the strange times...the book store expanded into two stores, one in the Main building and another in Army Hall...later in the spring of 1948, a compulsory Student Activity Fee replaced the inadequate U-Card as a result of a student referendum...the new $1.50 fee helped ease the financial worries of most organizations...In the Fall of '47 the administration banned a speaker who had been invited by the Marxist Cultural Society...students were aroused to their meeting to abridge free speech...Then another blow...the City College budget was cut by the Mayor's Budget Committee which later revisited its estimate and granted an additional $51,000...this reduced the cut to $127,000...students, faculty, and administration protested...28 instructors and 12 clerical and laboratory workers would have to be dropped...students looked about them and saw crowded classes...knew the budget slash would make the classes larger...a protest rally, a strike, and a march on City Hall were recommended...all but the rally was called off...classes were cut and the audience was larger at the rally...
						<br />
						Men and women returned from the war...back to the subway college...some back to become '48 graduates...some never to come back, except in memory and memorials...The vets were back...tired, eager to get their degrees as fast as they could...they became the plodders, the leaders...
						<br />
						The times changed and moved on...the College played host for the first time on May 1, 1948 to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers...distinguished engineers from the industry and universities spoke...awards were given for the best student papers...the convention closed with a dance at the Hotel Ascot.
						<br />
						A women's basketball team was started this year...under the leadership of Coach Rosalind Garfinkel, the squad suffered only one defeat in a 5-game schedule...the swimming team also turned a winning record, with five victories in ten meets...the nocturnal Basketball team won 16 of 21 games for another outstanding record.

						Seven hundred vets registered for the fall 1945 term. Their numbers were steadily increasing as more ex-students became ex-GI's.
						<br />
						Enrollment figures skyrocketed upward when College statisticians reported that 32,000 students registered for Spring '47. The influx of veterans led to the launch of a new student publication, Observation Post, jointly sponsored by the American Veterans Committee and the Veterans Association. A Centennial Week was held from April 13 to April 19. Men who had been graduated from the College years ago - Senator Robert Wagner, statesman Bernard Baruch, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter – came back to revive old memories, say a few words, and receive honorary degrees.
						<br />
						September registration in 1947 threatened to swamp the College: 33,000 signed up for some learning, 8,000 in uptown day session. President Wright submitted a $7,000,000 budget request in the Spring term of '48 but, in what was to be a recurring trend, the Mayor's Budget Committee reduced it - by only $127,000 after protests helped to restore $58,000 from the original cut.
						<br />
						City College's School of Business and Civic Administration held its Senior Prom on the evening before the blizzard of December 1948, with approximately 250 students celebrating the conclusion of their four years at City College in the Roosevelt Hotel. The other City College Senior Prom took place on January 27, 1949, with more than one hundred fifty couples attending the party at the Hotel Astor Roof. Freshman Coralye Isaacs was selected as Miss Subways, conclusively demonstrating, according to Microcosm, "that our girls can hold their own in the beauty and charm, as well as brains departments." The College's Centennial Fund Drive benefitted that spring from the proceeds of a special concert presented at Carnegie Hall by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra,conducted by Maestro Arturo Toscanini and assisted by stars from the Metropolitan Opera.
						<br />
						Controversy that had been simmering for years reached a boiling point when Judge Hubert Delany resigned from the chairmanship of a special committee set up to investigate discrimination at the College. Charging that the Administration was not really interested in ending discrimination, the jurist's resignation sparked a student referendum vote that led to a student strike beginning on April 11, 1949. Police and strikers clashed, and eighteen students were arrested. At the center of the turbulence were two professors, William Knickerbocker, Chairman of the Romance Languages Department, and Economics Professor William Davis, whom the administration refused to dismiss, despite evidence of discriminatory practices. Although the strike did not bring about conclusive results, it gained considerable publicity and made clear that a better rapport between Administration and students would have to be forthcoming, or future demonstrations would occur.
						<br />
						Following the interruption of classes due to the strike, students caught up with their studies and seniors prepared for graduation. The ceremony took place in Lewisohn Stadium, with some 2,500 students in cap and gown. For the first time in four years, it did not rain on graduation day, presaging a bright future for the Class of '49.

						The Class of 1950 dedicated its Microcosm yearbook "to our Educators," declaring, "we dedicate this yearbook to those instructors who were true friends - sources of inspiration to a student body appreciative of their fellowship and guiding hands." At the downtown campus, students dedicated Lexicon to "an idea which has blossomed into a reality": the Cooperative Work-Study Program.
						<br />
						City College in its post-World War II days saw a reactivation of student organizations and activities, and the establishment of Observation Post, a veterans' newspaper that was to become a worthy rival to Campus. Fraternities which had either collapsed or maintained skeleton membership during the war were now pledging record numbers.
						<br />
						The biggest snowstorm in New York history to date fell on the campus in the winter of 1947-48. "Bigger than the blizzard of '88," the newspapers said.
						<br />
						In 1948, the Young Republican Club appeared, along with Students for Wallace, YPA, and Students for Democratic Action - all in anticipation of the Presidential campaign coming in the fall.
						<br />
						In 1949, Campus favored Bob Rabinowitz '50 for SC president, and Observation Post favored William Fortunato. A third candidate, Student's Rights Coalitionist Milton Luchan, divided the votes, and Fortunato won. When Forutnato came to office his talents were taxed with the famous "Outst Knickerbocker and Davis" strike.
						<br />
						In the Fall of 1949 Observation Post ran a survey. The school paper learned from over 6,000 students that 1) 54% of City College students work full or part-time; 2) The average student has 20 hours and 48 minutes of leisure time each week; 3) 39% of all male students smoke pipes; 4) The average student spends $5.10 weekly for items other than lunch and carfare; 5) Three out of every 100 students are married, while seven more out of every 100 intend to marry before graduation.
						<br />
						The 69th annual dinner of the Associate Alumni was held in the Grand Ballroom of the Astor on October 22nd, highlighted by Milton Berle's gags and Kitty Kallen's songs.
						<br />
						Bernard M. Baruch, the financier, received the John H. Finley award.
						<br />
						On the evening of January 28, 1950, 300 seniors danced their prom night away at the Collonades of the Essex House to the music of the Mark Towers Orchestra.
						<br />
						The School of Business and Civic Administration held its senior prom on December 17, 1949 at the Georgian Room of the Hotel Statler. As noted in Lexicon, "It was a cold, clear wintry night, but inside, the air of spirit and fellowship warmed the entire room."
						<br />
						The biggest news of the graduating year for CCNY was, of course, basketball. The Beavers took the National Invitation Tournament crown, and then won the NCAA tournament. Lexicon devoted eighteen pages of text and photographs to the basketball "whiz kids." Sadly, the cheers and celebrations would be followed by sobering reality in January 1951, when the first arrests were made in the college basketball point-shaving scandal that would eventually involve at least seven schools, 33 players, and organized crime.

					<p class="timeline-des">
						Many members of the class of '51 graduated directly from City College into the army. Ominous reports from the battlefields of Korea created anxiety on campus and led to increased enlistment into the ROTC.
						<br />
						Students with ROTC uniforms and veterans were a common site on campus. As the editor of Microcosm explains: "The large percentage of veterans at the College made us aware of our inexperience; they gave us a goal, and we aimed for it....As freshmen, we looked upon the veterans as "big brothers;" we were the kids. We respected them, and, in many cases, we followed their example. To them school was a serious business; few of them mixed school with pleasure."
						<br />
						As the veterans returned home and resumed their studies, City College's enrollment grew. With additional students on campus, the need for more space became pronounced. In January 1947, the college was given the first of its "territorial acquisitions," a three-storied red building on the corner of Convent Ave. and 136th Street. This building became South Hall and provided a gym for men and women, and many classrooms. The College also received Army Hall for additional library space and classrooms, which it later gave up in order to acquire the Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart. Stretching along Convent Avenue from 130th Street until 135th Street, Manhattanville offered City College a much expanded campus.
						<br />
						In addition to acquiring a campus, the College attracted top faculty and began offering Master's degrees in psychology, technology, and education. The entire Engineering Department was also renovated and new laboratories were created. Without a doubt, the College was growing and thriving.
						<br />
						Along with long hours of study, students also enjoyed a number of special social events on campus. For one, there was the annual charter day which was celebrated with a colorful academic procession and a series of notable speakers. The members of the class of '51 entered City College in the midst of its Centennial Celebration in 1947, which included an even greater number of events commemorating the College's long and proud heritage. There was also engineer's day, when students in the tech school showed off their laboratories and work. Moreover, students enjoyed House Plan parties, the annual Christmas-Chanukah sing in Lincoln Corridor, and the annual boat ride organized by the Student Council.
						<br />
						Departing from a long tradition of June proms, the class of '51 held their senior prom in December. The change was decided upon by the Senior Council as a means of assuring that January grads who would be drafted before spring had a chance to attend prom. Two hundred couples turned out for the prom which was held at the Astor Roof.
						<br />
						The veterans on campus sought to find a voice for their experience through the creation of a second College newspaper, Observation Post. The newspaper, which started publication in February 1947, was sponsored by the Veterans Association to "emphasize the role of the veteran as a student."
						<br />
						In 1948, the College was given its first national championship by the fencing team. Leo Wagner '50 came to be known as the Beaver's "Mr. Football" because of his outstanding achievements on the gridiron. In 1950, the College's basketball team broke precedent by winning both major post-season tournament crowns in one year, beating Bradley University of Peoria, Illinois, in the deciding game each time. Three members of the Lavender's basketball team represented the United States in the Israeli Olympics in 1950; where they led the team to victory.
						<br />
						Eleven months after the basketball team had earned the title of "Grand Slam Champions" by sweeping through both major post-seasonal tournaments, it was discovered that members of the "Cinderella Team" had accepted bribes to "dump" three games during the '50-'51 season that were played at Madison Square Garden. Consequently, guilty players were suspended and the '50-'51 season was cancelled.
						<br />
						On April 11, 1949, CCNY students went on strike to protest discrimination on campus. This strike was covered by the media and much exaggerated with The New York Post running the headline, "Students riot at City College." According to Microcosm, "Students were fighting for the abolition of bigotry and discrimination from a free municipal college where such bias was contrary to a free exchange of ideas and to everything for which the College stands."
						<br />
						The "ominous specter of war" weighed heavily on the class of '51. The editor of Microcosm states: "This expression of extreme depression and pessimism was not an exaggerated symbol of true student sentiment; it did indeed clearly express the then prevailing mode of opinion. It was one of sharp concern for the inability of youth to dream, to plan to map out an individual future. It was one of complete despair. Male graduates of 1951 found it difficult to project themselves into the future; to them only the present was real. Somehow, the future, though vague at most times, was still vaguer, dense and ominous with the foreboding shadows of a war-like military future."

						The 1952 Lexicon was dedication to the "cultural achievements of the City of New York symbolized by the Stadium concerts." The concerts series at Lewisohn Stadium were extremely popular among students and had been a part of City College for 35 years.
						<br />
						In addition to the Lewisohn Stadium concerts there were a lot of other social activities taking place on campus. Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt returned to the Great Hall to speak. CCNY's first service sorority, Chi Lambda, was organized. The "Kissometer" booth was one of the most popular attractions at the Carnival. The first City College School-Wide Prom took place along with the Senior Prom on Thanksgiving eve at the Astor Roof. The Lamport Leaders Society was established. The society is named after Arthur Lamport, a CCNY graduate who became a renowned philanthropist. The School of Technology hosted its second annual Engineers' Day celebration, consisting of demonstrations and guided tours, concluding with a dance in the gym. The sorority Phi Tau Alpha was organized.
						<br />
						The Class of '52 also saw the College grow and expand its programs. The eighteen-and-a-half acre property from 130th-135th streets was given to City College and become South Campus. The College of Liberal Arts allowed women to enroll. The Graduate School of International Relations was established.
						<br />
						As freshmen, the Class of '52 experienced "the first general strike at a municipal institution of higher learning." In 1949, the student council voted to hold a general student strike to demand the trial and removal of both Dr. William E. Knickerbocker, who was accused of anti-Semitism. It is estimated that 65 percent of students participated by staying away from classes. The student council of the business school voted to condemn the strike.
						<br />
						The Class of '52 also lived through another CCNY controversy, the basketball point shaving scandal of 1950-1951. After winning the 1950 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball and the 1950 National Invitation Tournament, it was uncovered that four CCNY players shaved points in exchange for money. The basketball players were arrested and City College was banned from playing at Madison Square Garden and moved from Division I to Division III. The scandal shocked the student body: "Pride, enthusiasm, unrestrained joy, disappointment, shock, apathy—there are but a few of the varied emotions we, as students, displayed toward the City College basketball team during our four-year tenure at the School."
						<br />
						While basketball and most sports at the College were beset by various maladies and mishaps, the Beaver soccer team constantly improved as evidenced by its two Met championships in four years. The fencing team also managed to provide added laurels to the prominence of Lavender athletic squads. Hal Goldsmith was named National Foil Champ for the sport of fencing. The Class of '52 also produced some of the finest individual records in wrestling with sterling performances from Dave Lesky, Jerry Steinberger, and Bernie Lloyd.

						City College's President, Harry N. Wright retired and President Buell G. Gallagher took office. President Gallagher was very popular with the Class of 1953 and was described as "one of the finest Public Relations man in our history" in the 1953 Microcosm. He is credited to helping bring together students and faculty at the College.
						<br />
						In addition to a new College President, the Class of 1953 also saw the expansion of CCNY's campus. Eighteen-and-a-half acres of property stretching from 130th to 135th streets were given to City College, creating the South Campus. As the College expanded its campus, it also opened its doors to new students and created new programs. The College of Liberal Arts allowed women to enroll. The Graduate School of International Relations was established.
						<br />
						During their four years at City College, the Class of '53 attended many social affairs. There were numerous Lewisohn Stadium concerts, the Sophomore and Junior Proms, Theatron, Annual Boat rides and the First and Second School Wide proms. Close to 250 students attended the Senior Prom which was held on Thanksgiving Eve in the Northern Gardens and Belvedere Room of the Astor Hotel. 
						<br />
						The Senior Class Council planned a topsy-turvy Senior Day (when the Seniors assumed the positions of Presidents, Dean and instructors), the Senior Class Show, and the Numerical Lights Ball. The Inaugural Ball was held in the Great Hall. The annual Carnival took place in the Academy building.
						<br />
						In addition to these events, several student associations planned social activities on campus. The sorority Dean '53 hosted the "Land-a-Leg" booth at the Spring Festival. The group also took charge of a few engagement showers and weddings. Roosevelt '53 planned its first annual trip to Miami Beach. The Statistical Association held Easter Bunny Hops and Fall Turkey Trots. Hillel organized Passover seders, Succoth festivals, Purim commemorations, and Melaveh Malkah parties.
						<br />
						Several prominent speakers also addressed the CCNY Community. President Harry S. Truman spoke at the Alumni Association's annual dinner in November. Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke to a great number of CCNY students and faculty gathered in the Great Hall.

					<p class="timeline-des">
						Returning from summer break in 1952, the Class of '54 was greeted by a lanky, Lincolnesque Midwesterner who had just been chosen to succeed Harry N. Wright as the College's president. Dr. Buell G. Gallagher was officially inaugurated as the seventh President of City College on February 19, 1953 before 2,100 public officials, university delegates, faculty members and invited students. In his inaugural address, he denounced outside pressure on education declaring that <q>the people's right to know is key to all our liberties.</q>
						<br />
						In addition to a new College President, the Class of 1954 witnessed many changes on CCNY's campus. The campus grew by eighteen-and-a-half acres stretching from 130th to 135th streets, creating the South Campus. The student cafeteria opened a new bakeshop and the ancient Army Hall dormitories were shut down. The downtown center was renamed the Bernard M. Baruch School of Business and Public administration in honor of Bernard M. Baruch, a distinguished businessman and alumnus of CCNY. In addition naming the downtown center after him, the Class of 1954 devoted their Lexicon to Mr. Baruch.
						<br />
						As the College improved its facilities, it also opened its doors to new students. In September 1951, the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences became co-ed. It was the last school in City College to welcome women. Dorothy Schnabel '54 was the first women to join the Electrical Engineering honor fraternity, Eta Kappa Nu, and also the first co-ed to hold a badge in the engineering honor society, Tau Beta Pi. In May 1954, the College's newspaper, The Campus elected its first women editor-in-chief, Francine Marcus '55.
						<br />
						Students and faculty joined to survey the College in the first All-College Conference. Over a thousand participated in a series of panels on all aspects of College affairs. Student Council President Joseph Clancy was first to conceive of this project, which was carried out by the student-faculty committee.
						<br />
						During their four years at City College, the Class of '54 attended many social affairs. There were numerous Lewisohn Stadium concerts, Carnival and House Plan. The Farewell Ball for the Class of 1954 was held at the Hotel Astor. The Senior Prom included dining at the Hotel St. Moritz and dancing on the Astor Roof. The Business School held their prom in the Colonnades Room in Essex House.
						<br />
						Several prominent speakers addressed the CCNY Community. President Harry S. Truman spoke at the Alumni Association's annual dinner and Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke to a great number of CCNY students and faculty gathered in the Great Hall. Lilly Christine, known in burlesque houses and 1950's men's magazines as the "Cat Girl," toured the campus. Senator Herbert Lehman (D., NY) also visited the College.

					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1955</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">
						The fall of '55 opened with City College's second consecutive year of record breaking student enrollment. With 1400 students City College began its fall term with the largest number of freshman in its history. Along with this swell of new students also came the unveiling of the south campus making City College the third largest campus in the United States. 1955 also saw the closing of Both Hackett Hall, which once housed the theater department, and Abbe Hall. While Wagner Hall, the former dormitory for the nuns of The Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart, and the history department. In addition the education department was moved to the newly renovated South Hall with its "modern-looking classrooms" and "high illumination efficiency". Even with this slew of changes to the landscape, the College sought to expand even further calling for a new tech building and creating plans to update the infrastructure in Compton Hall.
						<br />
						Amidst the changes in scenery were changes in personnel, most markedly, the return of Coach Nat Holman (pictured left) to the basketball team. With a long history as a professional player and an accomplished coach, Holman began his 34th year coaching that fall. Two years prior Holman resigned amidst a controversy involving the misconduct of a few of his students but he was exonerated and welcomed back to the coaching staff by The President and students alike. City College also welcomed new professor Dr. Ivo Duchacek a man wanted by Eastern European communist parties for pushing anti-Soviet and pro-democratic views while running a London based publication. This along with the rest of the colorful cast of faculty members made 1955 a memorable year for students.
						<br />
						This cast of eager students was being composed more and more of a female student body, with more articles appearing in publications such as The Campus, referencing the fashion trends and the daily lives of female students at City College. The New Year also brought in four girls into the engineering department making a total of 15 female STEM students. While this may seem a small number, at the time it was an impressive step for women in the field, reminding everyone they met that engineering wasn't a boy's club.
						<br />
						The class of '55 found themselves enamored by the current events of the time, with figures such as Professor Hillman M. Bishop, a member of the first American Student Delegation to tour through Russia, providing lectures on the "Great Soviet Experiment. He told his students about the difficulties of finding out what was really happening in Russia and to value the freedom they had in the U.S. Students and faculty alike were exploring the world with their own eyes despite the fog brought up by the cold war. 
						<br />
						They also paid attention to events closer to home such as the marriage of the college President Buell Gallagher's daughter. Who married inside of The Great Hall. This ability to focus on both important world and home affairs is evident in the publication "The Campus" the City College Newspaper which entered its 48th year of publication. They also found other ways to enjoy their time off including live musical performances and writing competitions such as the folk concert given by Martha Schlamme in the Fall of '54 and the call to submit for the poetry competition.
						<br />
						President Gallagher was also one to promote open discussion of the quality of instruction at City College. In '55 he called for the 2nd All-College Conference, a meeting designed to evaluate the institution. By facilitating 21 workshops in which students and faculty could meet and discuss the methods for improving the college. They reviewed problems such as "curriculum, athletics, and intercollegiate activities." They did this in an attempt to garner greater student self-government.
						<br />
						Despite the discussions prompted by the return of Coach Holman, the athletics department was putting its best foot forward in bolstering the reputation of City College. The soccer team won the Metropolitan Intercollegiate Soccer Conference Championship continuing a three year streak despite the fierce competition against the Brooklyn College Powerhouse and the wrestling team had its best season since 1945. The City College track team closed off the year with a headline making performance against Adelphi University proving to everyone in the city, who the mighty were.
						<br />
						Apart from the prowess of the athletics department, the class of 1955 also saw eight of their classmates being sent to the seventh U.S. National Student Association congress in Ames, Iowa. 55dThese students represented City College in a national forum composed of students from more than half of the colleges in the country. Another group of eight students along with four alumni and four faculty members joined together, forming the board of directors in charge of the student union housed in the former John H. Finley student center (pictured left). They were partially funded by the Alumni Association and the College itself but a large amount of the operating costs were covered by a three dollar fee all supporters paid. The performance of the class of 1955 was impressive enough to warrant a duplicate of the Richard R. Bowker honor which was given to both Meyer Baden and Daniel Rosner. The award is reserved for those who do the most to further co-curricular activities at the College and was awarded to two people because of the "outstanding qualifications of both recipients." In total 42 students were honored by the student council with 18 (the largest number at the time) receiving major awards for leadership and service.

						A week after the Spring semester began, students gathered in the Great Hall with educators from 300 universities, colleges, representatives from 130 earned societies, and public officials. They were in attendance for the inauguration of the college's seventh President, Dr. Gallagher. In September 1955, the John H. Finley Student Center was ready for business when President Buell G. Gallagher opened the College's new eighteen and one-half acre South Campus, in a tape cutting ceremony. On Thursday, October 8, 1953, Bernard M. Baruch's name was incorporated into the college. 
						<br />
						There was the 1st Annual Baruch Ball, and 1st Annual Mardi Gras. Lamport House celebrated not only its 10th Anniversary, but a new House Plan emblem. The City College Swimming Team started slowly, yet captured their first Metropolitan title since 1948. On February 25, 1956, the Debating Society sponsored the first intercollegiate debating tournament held at the Finely Center with sixteen competing schools. Abbe and Hackett Hall made room for a new addition, P.S. 129., a modern elementary school. 
						<br />
						In March, a snow storm dumped fifteen inches of snow on New York City, causing President Gallagher to suspend all classes for two days. The April Fool issue of the Campus was suspended from publication. Due to items printed, Daniel Brophy, Dean of students, deemed the Campus, "an indecent publication." Consequently, seven managing board members were suspended from the paper and classes. The Ford Foundation contributed $15,000 to inaugurate the Liberal Arts and Science curriculum, and a total of $125,000 was received from the Rockefeller and Littaur Foundations, to finance a graduate program detailing <q class="purple">The New York Metropolitan Area As A Focus of American Urban Civilization.</q>

						The class of 1957 witnesses the College's transition as it expanded beyond the area it had occupied for half a century. The Manhattanville campus opens in the fall of '55. On October 8, 1953 - City College's Downtown Center was officially named The Bernard M Baruch School of Business and Public Administration. The Bernard M Baruch Distinguished Lecturer Series begins in the spring of 1953 when Bernard Baruch, Class of '89, delivers a three part talk on "A Philosophy for Our Time". The class of 1957 is the first 'business class' to graduate from The Baruch School of the City College.
						<br />
						Jonas E. Salk, City College Class of '34, makes headlines in the medical community in 1955 for developing the Salk vaccine, which represented man's quest over 'crippling infantile paralysis'. History major Herb Stempel wins $49,500 on television's "Twenty One" after being the program's champ for 2 months. The junior and senior class proms are memorable, taking place at the Statler Hotel and Hotel Roosevelt, respectively. The Inter-Club Board is organized to represent the many clubs, societies and fraternities at the Baruch School, including Alpha Phi Omega, Alpha Delta Sigma, Sigma Alpha, Gamma Alpha Chi, Phi Lambda Delta, Pi Alpha Tau, Beta Delta Mu, Phi Alpha, Sigma Beta Phi, Beta Gamma Sigma, Beta Alpha Psi, and Phi Epsilon Pi. In the spring of 1954, Lamport House celebrated its tenth anniversary with the dedication of a House Plan emblem consisting of a rope, a sword, a wheel, the CCNY seal and the letters <q>L</q> and <q>H</q>.
						<br />
						The ugliest couple on campus are picked and become known as the "Gruesome Twosome". The April Fool's issue of Campus reports that the College's seventh president, Dr. Gallagher lost a $200,000 endowment check in a crap game with Harvard President Nathan Pusey. Subsequently, staffers of <q>The Campus</q> and 5 managing board members are suspended. A dispute between <q>The Campus</q> and <q>The Observation Post</q> becames a major issue of the Student Council Elections.
						<br />
						The Basketeers have 2 winning seasons. CCNY wins the MET CROWN for 4 consecutive seasons in soccer. The Beavers certainly feel at home in the water! The Lavender's aquamen win 2 Metropolitan Conference Championships within 4 years at the College. Jerome Domershick, who served as team captain for three consecutive seasons ends his collegiate career in a blaze of glory, leading the Beavers to a smashing win over Brooklyn College. Wrestling has its best season in 10 years. One of the team's most dramatic moments occurs when Norman Balot, who is blind, gets a thunderous ovation at the close of the season for his courage and spirit.
						<br />
						Thank you to Dr. Ralph Schefflan'57 for his message of September 2, 2011:
						<q class="purple">Past Reunion Writeup has it all wrong re basketball. We had a winning season and were invited to the NCAA College Division Tournament. Jerry Domerschick was not on this team. The co-captains were Bill Lewis and Syd Levy.</q>
						<br />
						We stand corrected!

					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1958</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">
						College means different things for different people, but despite our differences we all seek to find our hidden talents by means of a good education. That's how the City College of New York and Class of 1958 found each other.
						<br />
						The College announced plans for a three million-dollar library to be built on the North corner of the uncompleted South Campus. The grand opening was eagerly anticipated by CCNY students. The new library, dedicated to the late philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen, would include the college's 45,000 volumes, reading accommodation for 1,500 and a smoky lounge.
						<br />
						The college basketball team finished its season with an 11-8 record, their best in six years and accepted an NCAA touring bid, but lost to Mount St. Mary 93-84. With no doubt, the class of 1958 envisioned one of the greatest triumphs presented by the City College track team. It was 1955, the "big year" for the college track and field team, who went undefeated and added the Collegiate Track Conference Championship to their laurels. This undoubtedly made Coach Harold Anson Bruce proud as he prepare to retire at the mandatory age of seventy. Unfortunately, Coach Bruce passed away in the spring of 1958.
						<br />
						April Fool's Day was anything but humorous for CCNY President Dr. Buell Gallagher when The Campus published an article that he lost a $200,000 endowment in a game with Harvard's President Pusey. Dean Brophy of CCNY judged the issue "indecent" and suspended the managing board and the publication. After a hearing, the Campus resumed publication under a new managing board.
						<br />
						The semester closed with the election of CCNY's first female Student Government President. Gloria Kingsley, an attractive blond, won by an sweeping majority. Mrs. Gallagher, wife of CCNY president Dr. Gallagher, officially inaugurated the student center's social facility by throwing open the doors of the Grand Ballroom to the first South Campus Friday Night Dance. The Campus called the overflowing crowd <q>the dream of years converted into happy reality</q>.

				<div class="one959-txt timeline-info-txt">
					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1959</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">
						<q class="purple">Don't – as you graduate – carry away the notion that your education is finished,</q> wrote President Buell G. Gallagher to the Class of '59 as part of his message in Microcosm.
						<br />
						The Class of '59 entered CCNY as its campus experienced a major growth spurt in September, 1955: The new South Campus opened, transforming the College from "a spacious court surrounded by stately buildings of Medieval design," as described by Mark Twain in 1906, to an eighteen and a half acre tree-spotted patch of greenery in the middle of the bustling metropolis of New York.
						<br />
						Lists and affiliations were recurring issues during the Class of '59's four years, as compulsory membership lists, initiated the term before the class arrived, were required of every student organization, drawing strong protests. Reflecting the tensions of the times, an invitation to Paul Robeson to appear at the annual Academic Freedom Week ceremonies was revoked, as Student Government President Jared Jussim expressed the fear that Robeson's visit might make the College look bad in the eyes of outsiders. Eleanor Roosevelt subsequently spoke on campus about conformity in Russia, while Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Peoples Rights candidate for the City Council, was banned by President Gallagher on the grounds that she had been convicted under the Smith Act.
						<br />
						The campus continued its transformation process. The Morris Raphael Cohen Library opened, and Drill Hall was torn down to make way for the new Tech building. With the cooperation of the Atomic Energy Commission, an atomic reactor was installed under Lewisohn Stadium.
						<br />
						The last Friday Night Dance, a College tradition since 1943, took place at the end of the 1957-58 school year. A lack of funds was blamed for its unfortunate demise.
						<br />
						Senior year, "Benny the Beaver," a 5.5 ton sculpture by CCNY alumnus Robert Russin, took up residence behind the Finley Center, facing the new library. A sportscaster named Bill Stern labeled City College, NYU, the University of Chicago and Harvard as "hotbeds of Communism" because they didn't have football teams (though, in fact, Harvard did have one). His observation was met with laughter by the student body. The Senior Prom was held at Tavern-on-the-Green, and a good time was had by all. The Farewell Ball, which took place just before Commencement, was a smashing success. Then came life after City College, with the hope, again expressed by President Gallagher, that graduates would <q>continue a life-long self-education,</q> thereby giving their alma mater <q>good reason to rejoice.</q>

				<div class="one960-txt timeline-info-txt">
					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1960</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">
						<q class="purple">Welcome to the Alumni Association! And to The City College Fund!</q> wrote Buell G. Gallagher in the opening of his letter from the Office of the President of The City College to the graduating Class of 1960 in Microcosm.
						<br />
						In fact, the 1960 Microcosm devoted a full page each to The City College Fund and the Alumni Association (pages 120-121). The City College's annual drive was in its sixth year, and proudly noted that almost $900,000 had been turned over to the College in that time. <q>The Fund has gone far beyond its original purpose - of providing for the annual maintenance of student facilities such as the Finley Student Center - by making available capital funds and annual subsidies for a variety of new and highly important College projects. It has become a vital factor in the development and growth of The City College.</q>
						<br />
						So perhaps, with considerable wisdom and foresight, President Gallagher was looking down the years to the Class of 1960's exciting 50th Reunion, organized by the City College Fund for 2010, when he saluted graduating seniors with that welcoming message. And, of course, the purpose of The City College Fund continues to expand, even as the Annual Fund and the unrestricted dollars it provides the College remains a key component of the Fund's work and <q>a vital factor</q> in CCNY's development and growth.
						<br />
						In these times when public service is much talked about and encouraged, at City College and in the larger world generally, it is also noteworthy that the club known as Pick and Shovel was doing its share way back when, before organizations like The Peace Corps and AmeriCorps had come into being. As Microcosm describes it, <q>Pick and Shovel is the Senior Honorary Service Society designed to honor those students who have devoted an outstanding portion of their time to extra-curricular activities. Pick and Shovel's main project for the last year has been working with the Foreign Students of the College.</q>
						<br />
						Playful activities were also encouraged at City College: the Gilbert and Sullivan Society presented a production of Patience, Dramsoc offered up The Male Animal, and the Musical Comedy Society sang the praises of "Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, MO" in Damn Yankees.
						<br />
						During their time as CCNY students, the Class of 1960 witnessed the opening of the Morris Raphael Cohen Library after years of planning. <q>This beautiful modernistic three million dollar structure</q> replaced Bowker Library which was demolished, along with Drill Hall, to make way for a new Technology Building. As the Microcosm writers put it, <q>the face of the campus was lifted but its pulse remained steady.</q>
						<br />
						The thorny issue of "membership lists" of student clubs and activities lingered from earlier in the 1950s. Also a hangover from earlier days, student publications were closely watched by the administration, with the prospect of censorship something to be guarded against. (The Spring 1958 issue of Promethean, for example, contained <q>non-suitable</q> material, according to President Gallagher).
						<br />
						On the science front, students were made well aware that they were living in the nuclear age: <q>With the cooperation of the Atomic Energy Commission, an atomic reactor was installed under Lewisohn Stadium, supervised by Professors Kolodney, Menkes, and Soodak. Another sign of keeping pace with the times.</q>
						<br />
						New York State approved aid to City College for the first time - a total of $2.7 million - in 1959, with the stipulation that non-city residents be accepted. So the fall of 1959 brought the first non-city residents who had been accepted by the College.
						<br />
						Also in that graduation year, House Plan celebrated its 25 years of existence with a Silver Anniversary Ball, and a very young Susan Sontag was a lecturer in the Philosophy department.
						<br />
						Downtown, the Class of 1960 decided to dedicate its yearbook, Lexicon, to Dean Emanuel Saxe, who assumed the office of dean just as the class of 1960 was entering the Baruch School.
						<br />
						The senior prom was held on the eve of Washington's birthday, at the Olympia Room of the Hotel Manhattan. It was Paradise for the Class of '60, and "fairest of the fair" Floria Klein, Queen of the Senior Prom, glowed with happiness.
						<br />
						A new decade was dawning, and Lexicon editors reserved judgment on what was to come: <q>Exit the fabulous fifties; enter the '___________ sixties.' (We leave the blank space for the phrase-coiners of this decade.)</q>
						Fifty years later, historians, social scientists, and many others of us are still trying to fill in that blank!

				<div class="one961-txt timeline-info-txt">
					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1961</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">
						The class of 1961 dedicated its Microcosm yearbook to CCNY President Buell Gordon Gallagher for his service to the College. Dr. Gallagher, who announced his retirement as the College's president, was extremely popular.
						<br />
						The years of the Gallagher administration brought the greatest expansion of the College since the early 1900s. The Manhattanville property, stretching along Convent Avenue from 130th Street until 135th Street, provided the College a real campus with a new library, buildings for the Arts and Humanities, a home for student activities, and a women's gym. A technology building was also constructed, and plans were drawn up for future expansion. In addition to the physical expansion of the College, Dr. Gallagher was accredited for revising the academic curriculum by adding even more Honors programs and exemption exams.
						<br />
						According to Microcosm, Gallagher's <q>outspokenness and leadership guided the College through the difficult days of McCarthyism, and provided opportunities for student-faculty cooperation in dealing with College problems. He, perhaps, more than any other person, was responsible for the organization of the municipal college system into the City University in 1961.</q>
						<br />
						In 1961, The City University of New York was established by action of the Board of Higher Education of the City of New York, and the Legislature, and the Governor of the State of New York. The movement led to the creation of The City University of New York from the seven colleges in New York City: City College, Hunter College, Brooklyn College, Queens College, Staten Island Community College, Bronx Community College, and Queensborough Community College. Under the new legislation, doctoral study was added to existing degree programs.
						<br />
						Similar to students across the nation, the members of the class of '61 participated in the cultural and political movements that now define the sixties. A great deal of student activism centered on ending segregation in the South. In protest against segregation policies, four busloads of City College students (between 150-300 students) gathered with students from other schools in Washington, D.C. for the March for Integration. City College students also supported the Sit-In movement in the Southern cities, led by Southern Negro students. In New York, over 300 students congregated at Woolworth's on 34th Street to protest the segregation policies of Woolworth stores in Southern states. In addition to segregation, more than 300 students gathered on the South Campus Lawn to protest an air-raid drill and the Vietnam War.
						<br />
						Concurrently with the rise of political activity on campus, there was an unprecedented rise in social fraternities. Defunct chapters were reactivated, many new chapters of national fraternities were started, and even house plans found it necessary to become a fraternity. According to Microcosm: <q>In as much as the primary function of all college fraternities is the nurturing of friendships and the perpetuation of relationships of social nature it is not surprising that they have witnessed an upsurge in number and total membership.</q>
						<br />
						In athletics, approximately 800 students competed in 21 Varsity and Freshman teams engaging in more than 200 contests with 50 different opponents during the 1960-1961season. The Lavender Mermen completed a highly successful 6-3 season highlighted and broke five CCNY records. The CCNY cross country team clinched the Municipal Championship—the first in since 1956, and finished with a 4-4 record. The Rifle team had their most successful season winning the Metropolitan Intercollegiate Rifle League title and finishing with an impressive 21-0 record.

					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1962</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">
						Throughout their four-years, the Class of 1962 put the words of the Ephebic Oath into action. It was a time when public service was much talked about and encouraged, at City College and in the larger world generally. Student organizations throughout campus sponsored public service activities: Alpha Sigma Rho sponsored a drive for the American Cancer Society, Zeta Beta Tau helped to renovate of a local community center, Alpha Mu Epsilon raised money for the Mental Health Association, and Phi Tau Alpha held a charity drive for the Blood Bank.
						<br />
						Like students across the nation, the Class of '62 took part in the social and political movements that now define the sixties. In protest against segregation policies, four busloads of City College students (between 150-300 students) gathered with students from other schools in Washington, D.C. for the March for Integration. CCNY students also supported the Sit-In movement in the Southern cities, led by Southern Negro students. In New York, over 300 students congregated at Woolworth's on 34th Street to protest the segregation policies of Woolworth stores in Southern states. In addition to segregation, more than 300 students gathered on the South Campus Lawn to protest an air-raid drill and the Vietnam War.
						<br />
						Fun, social activities were also part of the experience of the Class of '62. There was an unprecedented rise in social fraternities as defunct chapters were reactivated and new chapters of national fraternities were established. The Wright '65 sorority held a successful 'Twist 'n Mambo' floor show as part of the annual Mardi Gras. Shepard '65 won Best House Award for its Mardi Gras booth, 'Battle of the Sexes.' House Plan celebrated its 25 years of existence with a Silver Anniversary Ball, and a very young Susan Sontag was a lecturer in the Philosophy department.
						<br />
						At the end of their senior year, the Class of '62 saw the return of President Buell Gallagher, who briefly left his position at City College to head the California University system. He was a trusted and celebrated leader and his decision to return was celebrated by most students. The Class of 1962 also witnessed the opening of the Morris Raphael Cohen Library after years of planning and the creation of the Department of Architecture and Graphics.
						<br />
						In athletics, the Beaver cross-country squad established itself as one of the best athletic teams to compete for City College. The team brought the Collegiate Track Conference cross-country team championship back to CCNY after a lapse of seven years. The Lavender Mermen completed a highly successful season and broke CCNY records. The Rifle Team had their most successful season winning the Metropolitan Intercollegiate Rifle League title and finishing with an impressive 21-0 record. In fencing, Viro Manino reached all-American status.
						<br />
						The Class of 1962 graduated well-aware of the great responsibilities facing them and ready to make valuable contribution. As the Downtown Class of 1962 stated in Lexicon: <q>In our new frontiers, our educational backgrounds will be put to full use. We know the values of right and wrong and need only the courage of our convictions to prevent us from falling into the temptation on unethical and expedient practices, as may be used by many of our fellow citizens. We will dedicate ourselves to a new frontier where the 'what ought to be' becomes the reality of our world.</q>

					<p class="timeline-des">
						The 1963 Microcosm was dedicated to the theme of evolution. This theme reflected the great number of changes and developments that the Class of 1963 lived through during their four-years at City College.
						<br />
						The Class of '63 experienced the retirement and eventual return of President Buell Gallagher, one of CCNY's most popular presidents. The years of the Gallagher administration brought the greatest expansion of CCNY's campus since the early 1900s. The College grew with the addition of the Morris Raphael Cohen Library, Steinman Hall and the Administration Building. After years of planning, the College also added the Department of Architecture and Graphics. Also, in response to student demands, the student cafeteria was remodeled.
						<br />
						Along with the physical expansion of CCNY's campus, there was an unprecedented rise in social activities led by sororities and fraternities. House Plan celebrated its 25 years of existence with a Silver Anniversary Ball. The Wright '65 sorority put on a successful "Twist 'n Mambo" floor show as part of the annual Mardi Gras. Shepard '65 won Best House Award for its Mardi Gras booth, 'Battle of the Sexes' and held its second successful Pajama Party. Harper '63 organized a blind date party and several pajama parties. Hunt '63 held popular stag and drag parties, as well as Rathskellar beer parties. Jolson '65 was given the very first Outstanding Community Service Award by the House Plan Association. Beta Pi, the College chapter of Eta Kappa Nu, won an award for the most outstanding chapter in America.
						<br />
						In addition to these events, the Retailing Society held a fashion show, with the winner being given the chance to participate in Glamour magazine's "Best Dressed College Girl" contest. The show and its entrants were featured in a New York Post article. A very young Susan Sontag was a lecturer in the Philosophy department. Performer Dick Gregory held a concert on campus and gave all the proceeds to charity. CCNY student, Gary Horowitz received national recognition when he fought for, and won the conversion of Hamilton Grange into a national monument.

						<br />
						Red scare also had an impact on the life of the Class of 1963. CCNY students organized a "Ban the Ban" to protest the College administration's decision to ban US members of the Communist Party from speaking on campus.
						<br />
						In athletics, the Beaver cross-country squad established itself as one of the best athletic teams to compete for City College. The team brought the Collegiate Track Conference cross-country team championship back to CCNY after a seven-year lapse. With Olympic coach, Ed Lucia and two-time all-American, Vito Mannino, CCNY's fencing team came in sixth place in the NCAA championships in Colorado Springs. The steady performance of Frank Palka and Fred Grospin, led the College's rifle team to the top of the Metropolitan Intercollegiate Rifle League. Andre Houtkruyer, the fantastic goalie of the CCNY's soccer team was named to the All-American squad.

				<div class="one964-txt timeline-info-txt">
					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1964</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">
						The Class of 1964 dedicated its Microcosm to Dr. Morton Gottschall, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, who was retiring after 57 years at the College. Dean Gottschall many accomplishments at City College included helping to establish the social science research honors program; initiating the selected student program; helping to organize and sustain House Plan Association; and serving as an officer of the City College Fund since its founding in 1947.
						<br />
						The Class of '64 saw the retirement and eventual return of President Buell Gallagher, one of CCNY's most popular presidents. The years of the Gallagher administration brought the greatest expansion of CCNY's campus since the early 1900s.
						<br />
						In their junior year, the Class of '64 welcomed two new buildings on campus: the Technology Building-Steinman Hall, and the Administration Building. They also witnessed the improvement in the Finley Center, including the complete redecoration of Lewisohn Lounge, and the remodeling of the student cafeteria. After years of planning, the College also added the Department of Architecture and Graphics as well as its first Doctoral programs.
						<br />
						Along with the physical expansion of CCNY's campus, there was an unprecedented rise in social activities with over 150 student organizations on campus. House Plan celebrated its 25 years of existence with a Silver Anniversary Ball. The Musical Comedy Society held a rally in the Grand Ballroom with Liza Minelli entertaining. The Musical Comedy Society also performed a production of "Li'l Abner" at Taft High School. The Baruch School Committee on Human Rights and the Athenian Society were founded.
						<br />
						One of the most important issues for the Class of '64 was reinstating City College's tuition-free policy. In February 1963 a rally was held in Townsend Harris Auditorium to enlist student support for a free tuition bill pending in the legislator. In March, students organized a march in Albany. Since 1964 was an election year, students also canvassed certain politicians' districts with pamphlets and postcards for voters to send to their representatives.
						<br />
						Along with the entire country the Class of 1964 mourned the death President Kennedy who was assassinated on November 22, 1963. The College was closed for the day of his funeral, and the following day a memorial service was held in the Great Hall.
						<br />
						In athletics, the Beaver cross-country squad established itself as one of the best athletic teams to compete for City College. The team brought the Collegiate Track Conference cross-country team championship back to CCNY after a seven-year lapse. With olympic coach, Ed Lucia,CCNY's fencing team tied with Navy for first place in the Intercollegiate Fencing Association Eastern Championships. The swim team won second place in the Metropolitan Championships. CCNY's lacross team continued its winning record thanks to the efforts of Harvey Leshnick, All-American Defenseman in 1963 and Johnny Orlando, All-American Attackman in 1962. The College's rifle team was one of the top ten teams in the country and the best team in the Metropolitan Intercollegiate Rifle League.

				<div class="one965-txt timeline-info-txt">
					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1965</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">
						Fall of '65 opened with more than a few changes to not only The City College of New York but also to the very recently formed City University of New York. Dr. Reuben Frodin (pictured right) began his position as the new Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences bringing his experiences studying university problems throughout Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America to use at City College. 
						<br />
						On the student side of things, the college found its own student government restructuring itself to deal with a slew of issues caused by the heavy increase in enrollment. City College would welcome 350 more freshman than it had accepted in the previous year causing tension and unrest among the faculty. This was done as an experiment in an attempt to show that City College was <q>indeed an institution for the many and not for the few.</q>
						<br />
						The SG president for the fall semester, John Zippert, devoted his and his group's time and energy into advocating for changes such as free tuition and curricular revision. Zippert chose to devote the manpower of student government to help change public opinion and attempt to remove legislators who voted against the free-tuition legislation from power.
						<br />
						In addition to this anti-tuition front, he assigned his vice president to push for a change in the curriculum requirements for liberal arts majors, to reduce the number of math and science classes required of them. With this change in City College also came changes in the City University system. Dr. Albert Hosmer Bowker was inaugurated as the chancellor of the then three year old City University of New York, in front of 1500 University professors and the mayor, a testament to the importance of the City University system.
						<br />
						The class of '65 was one that knew how to entertain themselves. With events ranging from the "College Jazz Weekend", where for only thirty-five dollars one could enjoy an entire three day weekend of live jazz performance and the <q>Most Beautiful Man on Staff</q> contest held by Alpha Phi Omega. There were advertisements for traveling to study at UC Berkeley and to get jobs abroad in Europe, providing CCNY students with means to explore the world. 
						<br />
						The class of '65 was also a vocal group, speaking out on issues across the globe and in some cases breaking the law to see the world for what it truly was. During the summer of '64, four students traveled to Cuba despite the State department's ban on travel, resulting in several revoked passports. Jerry Weinberg, the head of the press committee for the 65dtrip said that the trip was a way to see socialism at work. 
						<br />
						Students at City College also engaged in dialogue about the movement for Puerto Rican independence, with Juan Nolasco (pictured left) secretary of the movement giving an impassioned speech in early November of '64. 
						<br />
						In the spring semester, the new student government president Joel Cooper petitioned for student participation in faculty council committees. By placing a student on faculty committees Cooper hoped to <q>establish a precedent of the Faculty Council listening to student opinion of curriculum matters.</q> This would become one of the biggest issues of the year with an article on student inclusion in curriculum revision appearing in almost every issue of The Campus.
						<br />
						The class of '65 also sought to better relations with not only each other but with the communities outside of City College. The Wright '65 sorority branch of House Plan scheduled Faculty Teas for the sisters to bond with their professors, while faculty and seniors alike enjoyed the festivities at the Senior Beer Party. 
						<br />
						The Alpha Phi Omega fraternity, or APO, helped out the community by coordinating the Blood Bank drive, as well as the semi-annual Used Book Exchange in an effort to spread health and knowledge. The group also held food drives and parties for the less fortunate during the holidays. The Student Council established a Book-of-the-Year project to get students interested in local and national current events. Sorority Sister Downer '65 performs duties such as holding a Christmas party for Bellevue Hospital's children's ward, and taking the children of the Henry Street Settlement House to the Hayden Planetarium. CCNY's only Honorary Leadership Society at the time, Lock and Key, coordinated the World University Service Council.
						<br />
						In sports news, Nat Holman the famed City College basketball coach was inaugurated into the Basketball Hall of Fame while fencing Coach Edward Lucia was named the alternate coach to two Olympic squads. In review, the College's rifle team compiled their best season with 13 wins and only two losses which they followed up with a top 20 ranking in the Intercollegiate Sectional Rifle championships. City College's tennis team, the Netmen, surprised the entire league when, despite having a new coach and inexperienced team, they played a nine win one loss season tying for best in the league. The College's track team had only a moderately successful season but still managed to break several records, most notably the records in 120 yard high hurdles, two mile run, and three mile run.

						<br />
                        Fall of 65’ opened with plans to build a five million dollar School of Education Building on South Campus. The plan met approval from the Board of Education in September and was designed with the addition of audiovisual facilities, lounges, industrial arts laboratories, as well as "classrooms geared particularly to teaching certain method courses," such as those in the sciences.
                        <br />
						In addition to a new School of Education building, City College’s School of Architecture won accreditation from the State Department. Formerly the object of bitter student protest, the School of Architecture accreditation status was rectified in May of 67’ just as its first class would graduate, in accordance with the rules of the national and state accreditation boards.
						<br />
			            Entertaining the idea of new languages, City College introduced the inter-university language program. Headed by Prof. Ivo Duchacek, the program allowed students to enroll for courses in “neglected” non-European languages such as Swahili, Hausa, and Chinese.
			            <br />
						In matters pertaining to the English language the author and alumnus, Henry Roth ‘28 delivered a speech in early October 1966 to the crowd gathered for the bestowal of his Townshend Harris medal at an Alumni Association luncheon. Prior to being given the award by Dr. Gallagher, he made known his plans to pen his second novel after 30 years without writing. 
						<br />
		                Student Government Educational Affairs Vice President Herman Berliner ’66 announced the reinstitution of the Student-Faculty Committee for School of Engineering and Architecture. Established 1955, the oldest faculty committee at the College had not been active for few terms.
		                <br />
						Students formed their very own “Anti-Draft” union in an attempt to disseminate information on how to legally avoid conscription. The War Resistors League advocated “open confrontation and resistance to the draft” as opposed to feigning physical and mental disabilities. Additionally, students and faculty alike came together to address the pressing issue of air pollution with Chemistry Professor Amos Turk. Professor Turk spearheaded the fight against air pollution with research sponsored by the National Institute of Health Research, as well as through his position as Chairman of the National Committee on the Sensory Evaluation of Materials and Products.
						<br />
						The author of the best-selling novel “Call It Sleep” – Henry Roth visited City College on November 16, 1965. He gave a speech at the Alumni Association Luncheon and after conducting a question and answer period Mr. Roth was presented the Townsend Harris Medal by President Gallagher for his <q>distinguished achievements in his chosen field.</q>
		                <br />
						In the first meet of the season at Van Cortlandt Park, the Beavers won over Adelphi University – 15-49. The Beavers took the first five places and six out of the seven spots, in the five mile race. Jim O’Connell paced the Beavers to their win over Adelphi with his easy win. Coach Francisco Castro was pleased with his team’s showing.

						The College's Master Plan is announced. The plan calls for the replacement of Lewisohn Stadium with a building for the humanities, and a Science and Physical Education building to replace Jasper Oval. The construction of a parking lot is delayed when hundreds of students block machines with their own bodies. They use cartons, wire baskets, and cafeteria trays to remove piles of rough stones from the lawn of nearby Mott Hall.
						<br />
						A referendum is held by students and faculty about the war draft. President Gallagher later decides that the referendum is not binding. The Board of Education orders the release of class standings of male students, which would in turn decide which university students would be drafted into the war.
						<br />
						More than 6,000 students and faculty protest band together to protest the proposal of tuition at City College, which threatened to end its run as a free institution. Students are surprised and outraged by hikes in registration fees and an increase in enrollment, ordained by the Board of Education. Students and faculty alike complain about the Administration making such important decisions without consulting representatives of the student body. Students stage a sit-in at the Administration building to protest the increasing number of decisions being made without them.
						<br />
						Mirroring The New York Times, the Campus halts printing after a disagreement with its printing service. The city suffers as a public transportation strike occurs, as well as a power blackout for the entire east coast. A blizzard later causes the school to shut down for two days.

						The year began with President Gallagher informing students of his fifty million dollar plan to demolish and replace existing buildings on campus. The new facelift for the campus would enable the enrollment of 4,000 more students.
						<br />
						The plans would change CCNY forever. Three new buildings would replace Klapper Hall, Lewisohn Stadium, and Jasper Oval. The reconstruction was symbolic to breaking old grounds and setting new ones, but many students and faculty did not see it that way. They all wanted to know, "Who would fund the CCNY make-over?"
						<br />
						Many students rejected the plan as it began to spring into action. Class members protested in front of "site six", where they had begun to build temporary huts for classes to take place. Some students physically blocked the construction by staging a stand-in. In the end, forty-nine students were suspended by President Gallagher; he later reconsidered and the charges were dropped.
						<br />
						That same year, CCNY was selected to serve as an examination center for the draft process. Student protest continued, this time over the presence of "on-campus recruiters".
						During the largest rally, 6,000 students and faculty aggregated to support the campaign for free tuition throughout the country.
						<br />
						The year wasn't all rallies and protests, however. CCNY students know how to have fun! Members of the Class of 1968 participated in the Caduceus Society, Debating Society, Eta Kappa Nu, Gamma Sigma Sigma, House Plan, Hockey Club, Modern Dance Club, Lock and Key, and the Musical Comedy Society, just to name a few. The Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity was voted the number one fraternity scholastically, as well as the most diverse. Also, who could forget their Friday night stags, and Saturday theme parties? Not only could the Class of 1968 party, but the class was also socially aware, as they demonstrated by giving back to the community.
						<br />
						This was especially true of the Gamma Sigma Sigma service sorority, among others. These women were responsible for staffing student government elections, ran the used book exchange, and helped set up many social events and gatherings. They also performed greater tasks outside of CCNY as well such as staffing blood banks and reading to the visually impaired. Alpha Epsilon Phi members adopted a foster child from Columbia, South America. Their great service and dedication to hospitals in New York city are truly traits to be revered.
						<br />
						Although the class of 1968 left in the midst of much confusion and renovation, those years of struggle and triumph only reinforce the fact that you've certainly earned your right to wear your Lavender!

					<p class="timeline-des">
						<q>A very unfamiliar City College will greet us when we return as alumni,</q> the 1969 edition of Microcosm prophetically declared. Although there was skepticism expressed about the quickness of the planned changes ("Lewisohn Stadium – to be demolished when we were freshmen, to be demolished when we were sophomores, to be...still stands as we leave," the Microcosm also observed), the College has indeed changed dramatically in the decades since that tumultuous time.
						<br />
						Dissent was very much in the air in 1969, and City College had its share of protests and demonstrations. Battles over budgets and demands over admissions policies ultimately resulted in changes far greater than those in the campus's outward appearance. 
						<br />
						An activist minority group called The Committee of the Ten issued the Five Demands in the spring semester, demanding greater representation of Blacks and Puerto Ricans in the student body, and more courses relating to Black and Puerto Rican heritage and studies. The volatility of the situation led to a police presence on campus, and eventually to the resignation of President Buell Gallagher on May 9.
						<br />
						Protests against the Vietnam War reflected the turbulence in the world beyond the City College campus. There had been demonstrations against Dow Chemical and other companies connected with the war effort; now, the College became a sanctuary: Bill Brakefield, a young AWOL soldier, was shielded by the "commune" and other groups in Finley Grand Ballroom. At the time of graduation, issues relating to the presence of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) on campus, as well as the outcome of demands for black separation in various College activities, remained unresolved.
						<br />
						A new President and a new admissions policy would be among the changes at City College shortly to follow.

					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1970</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">
						At the end of the tumultuous 1968-69 academic year, CCNY President Buell Gallagher tendered his resignation, stating, <q class="purple">When the forces of angry rebellion and stern repression clash, a man of peace, a reconciler, a man of compassion must stand aside for a time and await the moment when sanity returns and brotherhood based on justice becomes a possibility.</q>
						<br />
						The Class of 1970 graduated in a year of radical transition for City College. There was an Acting President in place, Joseph J. Copeland, and a successor to President Gallagher, renowned physicist Robert Marshak, was named. Meanwhile, Tech News reported in October that CUNY Chancellor Albert Bowker had created a University Task Force on Open Admissions. Chairman of the commission, Dr. David Newton, called open admissions <q>New York's Moon-shot</q> as he took on the mission <q>to mobilize the faculty-staff drive to achieve open admissions by 1970.</q>
						<br />
						Professor Osbourne Scott, named Chairman of the newly proposed Department of Urban and Ethnic Studies, declared, <q>We are in the midst of a revolution in education to make it more relevant to the people.</q>
						<br />
						Anti-war sentiments abounded, on campus and beyond, including a "Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam" held on October 15, 1969. Campus unrest about the Vietnam War reached a flashpoint nationally and internationally on May 4, 1970, when the Ohio National Guard opened fire on Kent State University students during a protest against the invasion of Cambodia, killing four of them.
						<br />
						Other events occurred on campus and off, not related to Vietnam or the issue of open admissions. The Engineering and Architecture Alumni, for example, sponsored an informal "get-together" for civil engineering alumni and current junior and senior students to <q>set the record straight</q> and <q>tell it like it is</q> at a <q>no holds barred</q> gathering at the Madison Room of the Hotel Roosevelt on February 27, 1970, initiated by George Curran '35 CE, College Affairs Committee.
						<br />
						Tech News devoted a fair amount of column space to theories about the <q>dead</q> Beatle, Paul McCartney. The paper also paused to note, ever-so-briefly, the actual passing of Jack Kerouac on October 21, 1969, declaring, <q>With the death of Jack Kerouac the curtain is officially drawn on the beat generation.</q>
						<br />
						Itzhak Rabin, Israel's Ambassador to the United States, addressed the student body on February 10, 1970 in the Finley Grand Ballroom, at the invitation of the Jewish Student Union.
						<br />
						Black and Puerto Rican students, through the Onyx Society and the Black and Puerto Rican Student Community, commemorated the death and celebrated the birth and life of Malcolm X on February 20, 1970 in the second annual event of its kind. A cultural program took place in the Great Hall from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
						<br />
						Twelve Black and Puerto Rican students and faculty met with President Elect Robert Marshak on March 24, 1970, to discuss with him, in a 90-minute session, his role in the future of City College. President Marshak would hold office from 1970 until 1979, a decade that would bring drastic changes to CCNY, in its policies with regards to admission and tuition, and to its reputation and standing in the larger world - changes well beyond anything that might have been mentioned in that 90-minute discussion on an early spring day in 1970.

					<p class="timeline-des">
						The following description in the 1970-71 Microcosm captures the scene of the campus at that time: <q>Ever walk across the campus on a nice spring day and just look around? There's a frisby game in progress, and there's football on the lawn. There's handholding, tennis and a rally at Cohen Plaza. There's a friend or two passing by, there's Raymond, City's own roundtable ambassador of good will, friendly conversation and often times slightly soggy pretzels.</q>
						<br />
						As a result of the Spring takeover in '69, in 1970 the College began an open admissions policy that allowed any graduate of a New York City high school to attend CCNY. The policy enabled a great number of students who would not otherwise have been able to attend college to earn a degree. Open admission, however, came at a cost. 
						<br />
						As Microcosm explains, over-crowding was a problem: <q>The lounges are crowded, the lawns are covered with bodies, registration is a greater hassle than usual because the temporary classrooms in the Great Hall turned out to be permanent. But you manage. You smile and you make do because you realize that this reality is the only way to equal educational opportunities.</q>
						<br />
						Tuition, at that time, was free, but there was a $58 Bursar's fee and loads of books and supplies to buy. CCNY's free tuition status was endangered by State cuts to the budget. In response to the threat of abolishing free tuition, students gathered in protest.
						<br />
						The class of 1971 participated in many other demonstrations. Student-aides working in Cohen Library and Finley Center took part in a peaceful, symbolic one-day strike demanding that they be paid the New York State minimum hourly wage of $1.85. The students triumphed. Also, the Puerto Rican Student Union (PRSU) occupied the offices of the Romance Language Department for alleged discrimination of the department. CCNY students also participated with students and others around the world in the Mayday anti-war protests.
						<br />
						The class of 1971 experienced a renewal in political activity on campus. Candidates running for student government launched vigorous campaigns, covering the entire campus with posters and leaflets. The New World Coalition, headed by James Small, swept the executive committee in the October student senate elections and also won a commending majority in the senate, carrying off 22 of the 29 senatorial seats.
						<br />
						Most of student government's position on the College campus centered around three issues—drugs, ROTC and the Day Care Center. In one of the rare moments of unity, the student senate unanimously approved a resolution calling for the removal of ROTC from campus. This vote was approved by the faculty senate. The resolution urged that the program be moved to an off-campus center to provide services for interested students throughout the metropolitan area. ROTC enrollment had decreased drastically both nationally and at the College, as a result of widespread anti-war sentiment.
						<br />
						The members of the class of 1971 enjoyed a great number of cultural activities on campus. Four thousand Aretha Franklin fans attended her concert in the open air of Lewisohn Stadium. The first big name concert at the College, the "Queen of Soul" headlined with bandleader King Curtis and his Kingpins, and the renowned poet, Muhammed Ali. A five hour rock concert with the Youngbloods, Jeff Cain and the Allman Brothers performing was the second big name concert of the season.

						The City College of New York Celebrated its 125th anniversary with a four-day conference in tribute to <q>the heritage and identity of ethnic groups in New York.</q> In his opening address, CCNY President Robert E. Marshak stated that the goal of the conference was to <q>to acquaint us with the backgrounds and heritages of some of the ethnic groups and&hellip;as a means of cultural and artistic appreciation of the intergroup understanding.</q> 
						<br />
						As part of the celebration, critic Alfred Kazin and novelist James Farrel discussed <q>ethnic identity or melting pot.</q> Ravi Shankar gave a concert and Puerto Rican, Asian, and Black student groups presented dance, music and dramatic performances. A group of 80 students disrupted the celebration charging that it was a <q>publicity stunt</q> and was unconcerned with the interest of the community.
						Diversity is the predominant theme of the 1972 Microcosm. City College had more Puerto Rican students than any other college outside of Puerto Rico, it had more Black students than the majority of Black colleges in America, and more Asian students than any American college outside of California.
						<br />
						The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, offered four new ethnic studies departments: Asian Studies, Black Studies, Jewish Studies and Puerto Rican Studies were created. A new program in humanities and the Institute for Medieval and Renaissance studies were established. New curricula were developed for the Schools of Nursing, Education, Architecture and Engineers to better prepare students for urban-related careers. The College also began plans to establish a Center for Urban and Environmental Problems.
						<br />
						The College's Open Admissions program, which was implemented two years early, was still hotly debated. Under the program, high school graduates in the city are assured a place on campus. Many open admission students needed additional academic preparation so CCNY expand its remedial course offerings.
						<br />
						Both sides of the Open Admissions debate where publically voiced when CCNY's Chairman of the History Department, Dr. Howard Adelson challenged President Marshak to defend his support of the program during a meeting of the Bronx High School of Science Parents' Association.
						Another controversial issue among students and a target of student demonstrations was the war in Vietnam and ROTC on campus. After 45 years on campus, in the spring of 1972, the ROTC program was quietly abolished as a result of dwindling enrollment numbers and the need to create additional room for the growing student body.
						<br />
						The need for more student space was altering the architecture of the College. As part of its master plan, the College was constructing a new 14-story, glass and cement modern building. The new Science and Physical Education Building was completed in 1973 and named after President Marshak. Through the generous support of Leonard Davis, an alumnus of the Class of '44, the College also began construction on the new Leonard Davis Center for the Performing Arts, a $7 million complex featuring a 750-seat proscenium theater, a 175-seat experimental theater and a 75-seat rehearsal studio-workshop.

						<br />
						The Class of 1973 was affected by the politics surrounding the 1972 US Presidential election and war in Vietnam. The prevailing sentiment on campus was that the Democratic Party presidential nominee, George McGovern was a better candidate for the country than Richard Nixon.
						<br />
						Hundreds of students turned up on the South Campus in September to hear Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden share their account of the war in Vietnam. Along with the protests against the Vietnam war, the ROTC program at the College attracted a great deal of protest. After 45 years on campus, in the spring of 1972, the ROTC program was quietly abolished as a result of dwindling enrollment numbers and the need to create additional room for the growing student body.
						<br />
						The need for more student space was altering the architecture of the College. In 1973, the College finished constructing a new 14-story, glass and cement modern building. The $32 million dollar Science and Physical Education Building was dedicated to CCNY President Robert E. Marshak. Through the generous support of Leonard Davis, an alumnus of the Class of '44, the College also began construction of the new Leonard Davis Center for the Performing Arts, a $7 million complex featuring a 750-seat proscenium theater, a 175-seat experimental theater and a 75-seat rehearsal studio-workshop.
						<br />
						Along with an expanded campus, the College attracted a number of prominent scholars and speakers. Feminist Bella Abzug and eyewitness reporter Geraldo Rivera spoke on campus. British author Anthony Burgess, who wrote A Clockwork Orange, arrived to teach a course on James Joyce, and make what seemed to be weekly contributions to the Sunday Times magazine on the life of the College. Fellow author, Elie Wiesel brought his wealth of knowledge of the Holocaust to the courses he taught as a member of the Jewish Studies Department. Sculptor George Segal and his ghostlike plaster people took up residence in Eisner Hall.
						During the years of the Vietnam war, and during innumerable City University budget crises, students, faculty, and the administration found that they did agree on many things, and they could work together to accomplish common goals. Under revised governance policies, many academic departments established student committees that not only advised the Chairman and the faculty, but actually took a hand in planning curriculum and hiring and firing staff members.

						The Class of 1974 witnessed one of the most dramatic changes to City College's campus: the demolition of Lewisohn Stadium. The 58-year-old arena, which had been a stage for historic concerts and dozens of College commencements, was torn down to be replaced with a modern academic complex, the North Academic Center.
						<br />
						The need for more student space was altering the architecture of the College. As part of its master plan, the College also constructed a new 14-story, glass and cement modern building. The new Science and Physical Education Building was completed in 1973 and named after President Marshak.
						<br />
						With the stadium gone, the newly constructed Aaron Davis Center for the Performing Arts became the center for culture and the arts on campus. The Center, which included a 750-seat proscenium theater, a 175-seat experimental theater and a 75-seat rehearsal studio-workshop, was built with the support of Leonard Davis, an alumnus of the Class of '44. It The Center's premier season in 1973 featured presentations of theater, dance, and music. The performances were open to everyone, on and off campus, and admission was free.
						<br />
						In addition to a new arts center, the College established the Center for Biomedical Education, a unique program that combines undergraduate education with the first two years of medical training. The School admitted its first class of students in 1963.
						<br />
						Lewisohn stadium was not the only landmark that disappeared in 1964. Raymond Rueben Haber, better known as "Raymond the Bagelman," the College's street corner philosopher and most ardent sports fan, went missing. After 26 years, Raymond abandoned his post selling pragels (pretzel made out of bagel dough) in front of Shepard Hall.
						<br />
						Outside of City College, as the Nixon administration sank deeper into the swamp of the Watergate scandal the intense political interests of the 1960's were gradually being replaced by a new social, cultural and ethnic awareness. At City College, ethnic studies programs were created in Asian Studies, Black Studies, Jewish Studies and Puerto Rican Studies. These programs began reaching out across lines of race and origin to encourage students to enroll.

						Fall of 76’ welcomed the student body amidst a proposal from the Board of Higher Education (BHE) to cut an additional 56 million in funding from City University. This upsetting proposal called for a large reduction in operating staff at the City College of New York, even going so far as to set forth a “four-week payless furlough for faculty, administration, and support staff”. The proposal was heavily denounced by students and faculty alike with approximately 3,000 students and staff protesting outside of the open hearing at the Board of Higher Education’s office. 
						<br />
						Despite the solidarity shown between students and staff the BHE pushed the cuts through. Even with a reduction in funding, the College was able to offer a variety of interesting courses to students such as a course on rare renaissance art. In partnership with the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Lehman Collection, City College students in the renaissance art course were able to study pieces of art which were never before available. In addition to in depth study of the classical arts, the College also sponsored a series of five symposia on television.
						<br />
						The symposia entitled, <span class="purple">“The Humanistic Responsibilities and Opportunities of Television”</span> was an effort to further develop television criticism and elevate it to the same level as literary criticism and other long-established forms of art criticism. The College also welcomed the Board of Regents’ approval of the College’s Center of Biomedical Education despite some stipulations. This Center offered students a more direct path towards Medical School under the condition that they spend two years working in a New York City Hospital upon earning their Medical Degree.
						<br />
						Entertainment throughout the year included such events as the Thanksgiving Disco Dance and performances by the CCNY Jazz Ensemble. The majority of these events were presented and organized by the Finley Program Agency, a large group that at one point had at least eight committees and 100 members. Advertisements for these events ran simultaneously with ads for events such as the Tau Epsilon Phi dinner and dance on October 3rd, which served food and wine before a Disco.

						The 1975-76 school year was an important one for sports namely basketball, with the City University basketball conference being created. This conference pitted the nine senior colleges, 76dBaruch, Brooklyn, City, Hunter, Lehman, Medgar Evers, Queens, John Jay, and York against each other for the conference championship. The Beavers proved their prowess at the CUNY finals where they beat York College 61-57 nailing down an invitation by the NCAA. City College’s Keith Bailey broke the school record for the 100 yard dash coming in at 9.5 seconds only half a second away from the world record.

						The fall of ’76 opened up with one of the most controversial moments in City College’s history: the implementation of tuition.
						<br />
						Some 12,000 students found themselves paying to attend City College for the first time in the College’s 129 year history. President Marshak addressed the tuition increases in a letter to the Class of ’77 in the Microcosm: <q class="purple">By the time you read this, most of the uncertainties that surround the College and the University should have been settled - for better or for worse. But the strain, the uncertain future of public higher education in New York City placed on your careers at the College, you will long remember.</q> Citing <q class="purple">the end of free tuition and the devastating effects of retrenchment,</q> he continued to an upbeat conclusion: <q>I believe that your affection for the College and for the City of New York will not diminish, for I am certain you will find that your academic and extra-curricular experiences at the College have prepared you well for the world you now enter.</q>
           				<br />
			        	At the same time the Class of ’77 mourned the end of free-tuition, the celebrated the faculty and other notable people associated with the College. Several articles in the College’s newspaper “The Campus” highlighted the achievements of the students and the dedication of the faculty at the College. Some of those celebrated include Margaret Mead, a famed anthropologist and the Curator Emeritus of Ethnology at the American Museum of Natural History, and Dr. Sharon Cosloy, a microbial geneticist studying recombination in bacteria at the college. One of the most notable staff members was Lucy Shames, a Lab Technician at the College who was heroically remembered as a member of a small guerilla group formed in Vilna, Poland during World War II. She spent 1941 to 1944 fighting for her life with a group of what started off as a dozen people against the 75,000 strong German army. Students of the College also celebrated with the community with the fall festival in March and also marked the 75th birthday of author Langston Hughes with a panel discussion.

			            Following a gap of more than two years, the Microcosm published a volume covering both 1977 and 1978. The book was dedicated to actor Zero Mostel, Class of '35 who passed away on September 8th. Famous for originating the movie role of Max Bialystock in The Producers and for stage roles in Fiddler on the Roof and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (among many others), Mostel was noted in a tribute on page 13 as a 1935 graduate of CCNY and one of its most enthusiastic supporters...Shortly before his death, Mr. Mostel was on the phone with President Robert E. Marshak, agreeing to serve as co-chairman of the National Alumni Committee for the City College Scholar Awards. In the <q>Respice</q> (look back) section of the yearbook, in addition to the tribute to Zero Mostel, there were photos of protests that took place on campus in the past, moving up to the near present, with students demonstrating against the proposed tuition and one sign reading, <q>NO TUITION, NO $1,100!</q>
			            <br />
					    Tuition was not the only change happening on campus. The physical appearance of CCNY was undergoing a drastic make-over, as the wide angle photograph of the North Academic Center under construction, with the Hudson River in view in the background, clearly demonstrates.

			            In sports, the College’s female Hoopster team had a solid 14-12 record by the end of the season and beat many of the previous records set at City College in women’s basketball. Whether it was number of points scored in a season or number of rebounds, the team truly outdid themselves creating a new pinnacle of athleticism for the College.
