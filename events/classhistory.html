					<h2 class="timeline-date">Class Of 1937</h2>
					<p class="timeline-des">For the first time in many years, the lower half of the Class of '37 are made of only male students due to non-coed admission. Incoming freshmen are welcomed cheerfully by the sophomore class with "extra curricular matriculation", a series of regulations informed while freshmen are crowded into a room. These rules include no mustaches, white socks, lavender and black tie, frosh [freshman] cap, bible or smoking. Pranks became such a problem that on November 16, 1933 the Dean's office issues a complaint from the police department against certain students who participated in the kidnapping of another student by means of a taxi. The students could have been shot if they had not been recognized by the police during one of the freshmen-sophomore activities.
					<br />
					The seniors of 1937 became known as 'social seniors' for their proactive attitude in the welfare of the campus. The Student Council and Student Body sponsor an anti-Nunan program bill as well as a non-pledge to Herbert Robinson, President of the Student Council, to any war the United States might conduct. Students and faculty hold four strikes in a vigilant effort for peace.
					<br />
					In May, class members are chided by the Board of Higher Education for "gratuitous obscenity" in the April Fool's issue of The Campus. (The paper is suspended for the rest of that semester, and two editors are expelled.) An investigation is launched by College President Robinson after "The Campus" newspaper publishes articles on the bookstore's mysterious $1,600 deficit. "The Mercury" is no longer known as "the sexiest of all sexy college periodicals", due to the efforts of editor Roger Helprin.
					Changes in military courses occur as money and supplies are granted to aid loyalists in Spain. Higher Education Week, Peace Week and actions from the Board of Education contribute to new legalizations, as well as a resolution to allow student organizations to be recognized if names of their officers, member and the organizations' principles are submitted. This is the first step to forming a club on the campus.
					<br />
					The Law Society is established in 1933. The Caduceus Society, a club for students on the pre-med track, is created in 1935. The Journal of the Baskerville Chemical Society is established. The 'Circolo Dante Alighuire' (C. D. A) is formed to promote social and intellectual well-being of Italian students at college. The Advertising Society begins, with the help of Fred Rosen. The fusion of two Jewish organizations lead to the formation of the Menorah-Avukah Conference. The newly established Interclass Athletic Committee is lead by Wally Klein. Captain Kotzebue leaves the Cadet Club, but Major Moore aptly fills his shoes.
					<br />
					The play "Squaring the Circle" becomes the Dramatic Society's most successful production in three years. House Plan activities are popular, such as the teas, and the mega Carnival. The Soph Smoker is a huge success. So is the Junior Jamboree. The class of 1937 celebrates beer becoming legal again by having a festival at the Hotel Brierfield. The Senior prom is held at the Tower Club of the Park Central Hotel. Professor Ross A. Baker is voted the most popular professor. Chamber of Commerce scholarships are awarded to Abe Briloff and Milt Lichtenthal. Two juniors B Gene Zorn and Charlie Gollup-become the first ever elected to the national honorary business fraternity Betta Gamma Sigma. Irv Kane and Charlie Rabkin share first place in the Cooper Blades advertising contest.
					<br />
					The athletes of Class of 1937 participate in a variety of sports activities, from water polo to boxing. Championships are celebrated for basketball stars Wally Klein, Ace Goldstein, Hal Kaufman, Sy Weinstein and Meger Samberg; fencing victors Chet Lambertt and Sid Kaplan; and wrestlers Milt Mendelowitz and Milt Lauter. Coach Benny Friedman leads the football team to a bittersweet glory, as Aaron Greenwald passes away due to injuries from a football game against NYU in the fall of 1937.</p>
