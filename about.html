					The City College Fund is a tax-exempt 501c(3) non-profit fundraising organization, established in 1946. Gifts to The City College Fund directly benefit our extraordinary students and scholars, who come to the College to take advantage of the outstanding opportunities that a CCNY education provides, with our renowned faculty, innovative programs and schools.
					<br />
					Although the cost of a CCNY education remains low compared to most other colleges, approximately 60% ofour students come from families with a combined annual income of $30,000 or less. That makes tuition a major obstacle to continuing their education, unless the College can provide adequate scholarships and financial aid. And that is why we must seek the support of alumni, friends, foundations and corporations - and why our students are relying on you.
					<br />
					Gifts to the Annual Fund help us to keep the College vibrant and competitive, as government support covers only a fraction of the College's budget. The Annual Fund is crucial in the creation and maintenance of important educational initiatives such as unique study abroad programs, our award-winning Model U.N. Team, and valuable undergraduate research opportunities. These funds are also imperative for physical plant renovations and improvements (including in recent years the Nat Holman Gymnasium and the Morris Raphael Cohen Library).
					<br />
					Additionally, The City College Fund administers and supports numerous special programs, such as the CCNY Baseball Project which brought the sport back to City College in 2004, the President's Fund for Excellence, endowed lecture series, endowed professorships, and the CCNY Scholarship Projects. The Scholarship Projectshelp bring some of the city's highest achieving students to the CCNY honors programs and Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education and strengthen ties between CCNY and New York City's public high schools.
					<br />
					The Fund also organizes and oversees the 25th, 40th, 50th, 60th and 70th alumni class anniversary reunionsthat occur in conjunction with the College's commencement ceremony each spring, recruiting the class reunion committees and working with each committee to meet their goal for their anniversary gift.
