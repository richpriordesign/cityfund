					The City College Fund provides scholarship awards for all of the College’s academic departments. Requirements for these scholarships may be based on a student’s field of study, financial need, the maintenance of a certain GPA, or a combination of these. Many of the scholarships are renewable for up to four years. These financial awards mitigate the burden of tuition and allow students to concentrate solely on their studies and extra-curricular activities, giving them the best possible college experience.  Our bright and motivated students take full advantage of CCNY’s scholarship opportunities to earn other prestigious awards. The scholarship assistance offered by the City College Fund helps them to transform their life. 
				</p>

				<p class="light">
					For many CCNY students, scholarship aid is not a luxury, but imperative to their ability to earn a college degree. The majority of CCNY come from families with severely limited means. Approximately 60 percent of our students come from families with an annual income of $30,000 or less, often barely getting by as it is, before factoring in the cost of tuition, books, supplies, and other expenses. Many are new to America, immigrants themselves or children of immigrants, whose families are struggling to make ends meet. Without scholarship aid, many of these young people may have no other option than to give up on their dream of attending college. 
				</p>

				<p class="light">
					In addition to City College Fund’s general scholarship, the Fund has also created several special scholarships designed to attract the brightest students in New York City to City College.
				</p>

				<h4 class="purple awarded caps">
					 These special scholarships include:

				<p class="light">
					<span class="purple subtitle">Stuyvesant-CCNY Scholarship Project</span> <br class="award-titles">The Stuyvesant-CCNY Scholarship Project is a crucial link between City College and the prestigious Stuyvesant High School. Since the Project's inception in 2002, it has brought a new wave of talented Stuyvesant students to CCNY.  The Scholarship provides up to $5,000 a year over four years for exceptional students who graduate with a minimum SAT score of 1300 or the equivalent ACT score and an 85 high school average from Stuyvesant High School. 
				</p>

				<p class="light">
					<span class="purple subtitle">Bronx Science-CCNY Project</span> <br class="award-titles">The Bronx Science-CCNY Scholarship Project is truly a remarkable program as it enables City College to strengthen its historic relationship with the Bronx High School of Science. The Bronx Science-CCNY Scholarship Project welcomed its first project scholars to CCNY in the Fall of 2005, and new applications are arriving constantly. The Scholarship provides up to $5,000 a year over four years for exceptional students who graduate with a minimum SAT score of 1300 or the equivalent ACT score and an 85 high school average from Bronx Science High school.

The Scholarship provides up to $5,000 a year over four years for exceptional students who graduate with a minimum SAT score of 1300 or the equivalent ACT score and an 85 high school average from Brooklyn Tech High School.
