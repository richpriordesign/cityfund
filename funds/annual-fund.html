					Gifts to the Annual Fund provide immediate support to areas of greatest need for the College. Through telephone and mail, the City College Fund reaches out to alumni and friends with updates on the College and requests for support. The reward for giving each fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) is knowing that you are helping to educate the world's future leaders while upholding the value of a CCNY degree and maintaining its prestigious reputation.
				</p>

					&ldquo;CCNY is the place where my ambitions were fostered, rather than dashed; a college whose greatest asset is the very students who harbor those ambitions. That is why City College means so much to me. I was blessed to be the recipient of the generosity of CCNY's alumni. Now, when I receive donation appeals from The City College Fund, I send a check without hesitation because I know what a difference I can make in someone else's life.&rdquo; &mdash;Sabeen Perwaiz '06
				</p>

				<p class="light no-pad-bottom">
					CCNY has once again become a leader in public education. Gifts to the Annual Fund have helped to make this transformation possible by providing a flexible source of revenue for the College. The Annual Fund supports strategic initiatives critical to the success of our faculty and students. With these resources, College leaders are able to continue and advance CCNY's mission of Access and Excellence.

					The Inner Circle
				</h4>

				<p class="light m-top1">
					The Inner Circle is made up of those donors who make a monthly gift to the City College Fund.
				</p>

				<p class="light">
					Why are we asking for month-by-month gifts instead of a one-time donation? The work of fostering a sustainable Annual Fund requires long-term commitment. Automatic monthly gifts provide us with the day-to-day support the College needs, in a way that's more convenient for you and much more cost-effective for us. Your monthly credit card statement will clearly show the amount and date of your gift, making your annual donations easy to track for tax purposes. You may change your pledge or cancel your pledge at any time.
				</p>

				<p class="light">
					As a member of the Inner Circle, you will benefit from a closer connection with CCNY. You will receive special recognition in college publications, invitations to special events, and unique opportunities to interact with college administrators and other alumni.
				</p>

				<p class="light no-pad-bottom">
					CCNY remains committed to moving forward and advancing its mission of Access and Excellence. Your monthly Annual Fund gift is one of the best ways to insure that we are able to fulfill this mission. It's convenient, hassle-free giving that makes a huge impact on our students and faculty. Please download our brochure for more information.

					Gifts of Securities
				</h4>

				<p class="light m-top1">
					A stock portfolio is often among the most valuable assets you own, and one that carries substantial capital gainâ€”appreciation in value. The downside to assets that have increased in value over the years is that the federal government is prepared to levy taxes of up to 15 percent on your capital gain from securities. With careful planning, you can reduce or even avoid federal capital gains tax. We can show you how charitable giving may be one of your best defenses against capital gains taxes.
				</p>

				<p class="light no-pad-bottom">
					As stock prices increase, so do the taxes you owe on the capital gain, which are generally charged at a rate of 15 percent (0 percent if you are in the 10 and 15 percent tax brackets) through 2010. But when you donate publicly traded stocks held long term (owned for more than one year) to a qualified charitable organization such as the City College Fund, you avoid all capital gains taxes. Plus, you may take the full fair market value of the stock gift as a charitable deduction on your income taxes. The maximum deduction you may take within a given tax year is 30 percent of your adjusted gross income. If you are unable to take the entire deduction in one year, you may carry the excess deduction forward for five additional years.
