					Education is the kindling of a flame, In the summers of 2013 and 2014, The City College Fund, through the generosity of alumna Pat Hill ‘76, partnered with the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art in London to provide a once-in-a-lifetime experience for some of CCNY's most talented performing arts majors.

					&ldquo;It was an incredible adventure to study Shakespearean acting at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts. To say that it was life-changing does not come close to expressing what this experience has meant for me.
				</p>

				<p class="light">
					Since returning to New York City and my classes at City College, I have striven to carry what I encountered on the mountain top down into the trenches. So far, I am pretty excited about the results. I have always loved all of my classes and activities at City College, and now I feel that I can truly engage with them at such a greater depth than I was capable of before.

				</p>

				<p class="light">
					What is common to every student at City College is that we all understand what a gift this education is because we are all so invested in it ourselves. Many students are working to help put themselves through school or support their families or both. Many are the first in their families to graduate from college. City College has given me a second chance at life- a second chance to pursue my passion and create the life for myself that I always imagined.&rdquo; &mdash;Rachel Foote Baccus
