					The City College Fund provides our donors with the opportunity to create named scholarships awards, professorships, lectures and other special funds. The special opportunities are a wonderful way to honor the memory of someone, to highlight a particular area of study, or simply to enrich the intellectual or creative offerings of The City College of New York for all of its constituents: alumni, friends, faculty, and, of course, current students. For further information on establishing or supporting a special project at City College, please call Elena Sturman at <a class="purple" href="tel://1-212-650-6529">212-650-6529.

					Endowed Lecture Series
				</h4>
				
				<p class="light">
					A gift to endow a lecture series can greatly add to the life of the College, reaching out to students, faculty, and the community at large. One such endowed series is the annual Louis Levine - Gabriella de Beer Lecture in Genetics.
				</p>
				
				<p class="light">
					Gabriella de Beer retired as a Professor of Spanish at the City College of New York, and is the author of Contemporary Mexican Women Writers: Five Voices. She established the lecture series in memory of her husband, Professor Louis Levine, a City College alumnus who taught in the Department of Biology and The Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education, participated in bi-national research studies in Mexico, was Visiting Professor at the Technion (the Israel Institute of Technology) in Israel, and in later years served as a consultant and expert witness in criminal cases involving DNA evidence. The aim of these annual lectures is to perpetuate Professor Levine's lifelong interest in the ever-expanding field of genetics.
				</p>

				<p class="light">
					The lectures take place in The Great Hall of Shepard Hall at The City College of New York, with a reception following. Dr. Francisco J. Ayala, a noted evolutionary biologist and geneticist, delivered the inaugural lecture, entitled Design without Designer: Darwin's Most Significant Discovery, in the spring of 2008.
