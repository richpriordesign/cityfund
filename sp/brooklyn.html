					&ldquo;Being able to attend architecture school has been something I've been wanting since 8th grade. That desire drove me to Brooklyn Tech HS's architecture major and it then led me to City College.

					I was also accepted into Pratt Institute, NYIT, Penn State, as well as several other schools. Had I decided to attend any one of them, I would have had to take out loans and work part-time. Being the first person in my family to attend college, it was important for me to be able to focus on my studies, particularly because of the demanding major I chose to study.
				</p>

				<p class="light">
					My first year studying at the Spitzer School of Architecture has taught me a great deal. The environment is something quite special; students are facilitated with great studio space which I am grateful for because it is where we spend the most time. The program creates a close knit family of students and professors that grow and learn from one another in the time we spend together.

					The CCNY Honors Program and my scholarship have allowed me to focus on learning. The scholarship has lifted a great burden from my family's shoulders and I am extremely grateful for it. I look forward to growing as a student and designer here in the years to come.&rdquo; &mdash;Fahmida Ali, Class of 2017
