					When Bob Adler '58 learned that baseball at CCNY had been discontinued due to budget cuts, he made a financial commitment to underwrite the program and raise funds from alumni and friends. He was honored for his efforts by the Alumni Varsity Association at their Hall of Fame Dinner in 2006.				
					<span class="dropquote">Reconnected to the College, Bob joined the board of The City College Fund. </span>

				<p class="light">
					Reconnected to the College, Bob joined the board of The City College Fund. He has since created a scholarship for the renewed ROTC program, supported Theatre on campus, contributed to the Jewish Studies program and lectured in the Economics Department on business and ethics and other topics. He also acts as a recruiter for baseball and basketball recruits-extolling the virtues of our great institution to high school candidates.
